  "DIA_Fynn_Who_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Fynn_Who_03_02": "My name is Fynn and I am responsible for recruiting for the mines and exchanging miners' output for gold coins. Are you looking for a job?",
  "DIA_Fynn_Work_15_01": "I'd like to work as a miner.",
  "DIA_Fynn_Work_03_02": "We're about to find out what you can do. Follow me.",
  "DIA_Fynn_See_03_01": "See this deposit? It's mostly been emptied, but it should be enough to test your skills.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_01": "All right, let's summarize:",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_02": "You're not bad with a pickaxe.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_03": "You're a good miner.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_04": "You also belong to our organization.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_05": "But unfortunately, you are one of Roderich's people.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_06": "But you don't belong to our organization.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_07": "The final terms of the agreement I can give you are as follows:",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_08": "You will receive half of the extracted ore.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_09": "You'll get to keep three of the four nuggets you extracted.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_10": "In addition, you won't pay anything to enter our mine. We have to support our own people.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_11": "Due to increased taxes and business costs, the entry fee will be 200 gold pieces.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_12": "The fee to enter the mine will cost you 100 gold pieces.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_13": "I would just like to remind you that the terms are non-negotiable and the contract is valid from the time you enter the mine until you leave it.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_14": "For safety reasons, you will be required to pay an entry fee each time you enter, and a portion of the spoils due will be collected when you leave the mine.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Finish_03_15": "So, shall we sign?",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Yes_15_01": "Sure, sounds like pretty reasonable terms.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Yes_03_02": "Excellent! Here's the contract to sign.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Yes_03_03": "Great, whenever you're ready, head inside.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Yes_03_04": "One more thing, if you have any gold nuggets on you, you better not enter the mine with them. On your way out you will be accounted for all which you have!",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_No_15_01": "That doesn't sound like a good offer.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_No_03_02": "You won't get a better one here, if it doesn't suit you, you can always pick turnips in Silbach.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_03_01": "Okay, let's tally up how many nuggets you were able to get.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_03_02": "Damn, it's been a long time since I've seen someone handle a pickaxe so professionally. I don't need to see anything else. You got the job.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Next_03_02": "Not bad, pretty good! I think you'll find your way around our mine.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_Next_03_01": "With that kind of efficiency, you'll only waste our resources. Come back when you can hit a rock hard.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_GiveAll_Next_Finish_No_Choice": "That doesn't sound like a very good offer.",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_GiveAllAndYours_Choice": "(Return the extracted nuggets and add 5 of your own)",
  "DIA_Fynn_AfterTest_GiveAll_Choice": "(Hand over all the extracted nuggets)"
