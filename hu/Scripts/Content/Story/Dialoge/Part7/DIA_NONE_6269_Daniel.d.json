  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_03_02": "L-leave me a-alone!",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Kill_15_01": "Sorry, but it's nothing personal.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Kill_03_02": "Wh-what?! What's that sound?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Kill_03_03": "NO! I don't want to die!",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Who_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Who_03_02": "I'm D-Daniel. I'm a junior g-guard from Sergeant G-Gerwin's unit.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Who_03_03": "I-I don't recognize y-your voice...",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Who_15_04": "Guess you could say I'm new here.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Who_03_05": "Oh... thank god...",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Who_15_06": "Have you been here long?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Who_03_07": "A couple of days. It's not easy and I only eat what I manage to catch. Mostly grubs and meatbugs. But it will be over soon.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Who_15_08": "What do you mean by that?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Who_03_09": "The fact that my colleagues are already coming for me, and then they'll disperse this bunch to the four winds!",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Join_15_01": "I have bad news.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Join_15_03": "No one is coming for you because no one has any idea what happened to the unit.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Join_03_04": "What the... What do you mean? You're lying!",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Join_15_05": "I'm sorry, but it's true. I'm the first guard from the outside to get in here.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Join_03_06": "Since no one knows what happened and you're here... oh, no... does that mean that...",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Join_03_07": "I don't want to die!",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Join_15_08": "You don't have to. Just do whatever Salvi wants you to do. At least for now. You understand?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Join_03_09": "Shall I... betray my captain...? Betray the unit I serve?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Scare_15_01": "You hear that sound? It doesn't have to end this way for you.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Scare_03_02": "Wh-what... do you want?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Scare_15_03": "Go to Salvi's side and do what he tells you and you'll live to see another day. Got it?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Scare_03_04": "A-all right... I'll do what you want, just put down that thing...",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_GerwinDead_15_01": "The unit you serve is long gone. What's left is a gang who only understands power.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_GerwinDead_15_02": "I'm giving you a chance, but the choice is yours.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_MySake_15_01": "If you don't do what I say, they'll kill me too. I don't know about you, but I don't want to die.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_MySake_03_02": "No way, I'm not going to be fooled! My comrades will be here any minute... I'm sure of it.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Save_15_01": "You have to promise me something.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Save_03_02": "Wh-what?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Save_15_03": "I'm gonna free you. Then run out of here as fast as you can. I'll take care of Salvi and the others.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Save_03_04": "Is this a trick?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Save_15_05": "No trickery. I'm releasing you.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Save_15_06": "Roderich needs to find out what happened here.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Save_03_07": "No way, I'm not going to be fooled! My comrades will be here any minute... I'm sure of it.",
  "DIA_Daniel_Ambient_15_00": "How are you doing?",
  "DIA_Daniel_Ambient_13_01": "N-no... I don't want to die...!",
  "DIA_Daniel_Ambient_13_03": "Wh-what do you want?! Leave me alone!",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Save_Choice": "(Try to free Daniel)",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Kill_Choice": "(Kill Daniel)",
  "DIA_Daniel_Q205_Renegade_Join_MySake_Choice": "If you don't do what I tell you to do, they'll kill me too.",
