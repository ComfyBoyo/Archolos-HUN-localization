  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_03_04": "Who are you and what are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Gerwin_15_01": "Gerwin's.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Gerwin_03_02": "Really?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Gerwin_03_03": "That's very interesting, because I thought we were the ones from it.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Gerwin_15_04": "I mean...",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Gerwin_03_05": "You're trying to deceive me, boy, and I don't like it.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Gerwin_03_06": "The sergeant will definitely want to talk to you.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Gerwin_03_07": "But first, let's have some fun!",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Roderich_15_01": "Roderich sent me.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Roderich_03_02": "And why did the commander send you so far from home?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Search_15_01": "I'm looking for Sergeant Gerwin. Roderich hasn't heard from him in a week.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Search_03_02": "In that case, we'd be happy to take you to him.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Pay_15_01": "To be an errand boy and earn a few coins for it.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Pay_03_02": "You can't help it. That's the fate of a city man.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Pay_03_03": "You work your ass off, and you get as much as a molerat can dig up.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Pay_03_04": "We, for example, don't have to work hard anymore and we can afford the best wine in the area.",

  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Who_15_01": "Who's in charge now?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Who_03_02": "Someone who has a head on his shoulders and doesn't blindly listen to Roderich's foolish orders.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Who_03_03": "The guy may be the leader, but at least we have a lot of freedom. And we can drink as much beer as our bellies can hold!",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_What_15_01": "What happened to the previous sergeant?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_What_03_02": "He decided to go for a little swim.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_What_15_03": "Swim?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_What_03_04": "Till said he swelled up a bit last night, so the lurkers aren't likely to touch him again, but the scavengers...",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_What_03_05": "That's a whole other story.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_What_03_06": "These birds will not despise even a few weeks old meat. Hahahaha!",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WhatDo_15_01": "Actually, what are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WhatDo_03_02": "You ask too many questions. Let me ask you a question for a change.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WhatDo_03_03": "Are you with us or with Roderich?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WithGerwin_15_01": "With you, of course.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WithGerwin_03_02": "Yeah? We're about to find out.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WithGerwin_03_03": "The sergeant will definitely want to talk to you.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WithGerwin_03_04": "But first, you have to give me your weapon. Safety regulations, you understand.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WithGerwin_15_05": "You want me to give you my weapon?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WithGerwin_03_06": "Do you have a problem with that?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WithRoderich_15_01": "Roderich will know of your betrayal.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_WithRoderich_03_02": "Sorry, boy, but this is where I have to disagree with you.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Keep_15_01": "I think I'll keep it with me after all.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Keep_03_02": "I dare to disagree with you.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Give_15_01": "No, of course not.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Give_03_02": "You know what, boy? I'm thinking it must be hard as hell for you with all that stuff.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Give_03_03": "We'd be happy to watch them for you, while you talk to the boss.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Give_03_04": "Follow me. Just don't try any tricks.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Oktav_15_01": "Oktav's.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_NoOne_15_01": "I don't belong to any unit.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_NoOne_03_02": "So you're a rookie.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_NoOne_03_03": "I don't know how you found us here, but the sergeant will certainly want to talk to you.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_NoOne_15_04": "You mean Sergeant Gerwin?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_NoOne_03_05": "Not really, but if you really want to, you'll meet him too.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_SearchGerwin_15_01": "I'm looking for Gerwin's unit.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_SearchGerwin_03_02": "In that case, it's your lucky day, boy. We'd be happy to take you to the sergeant.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Lost_15_01": "I guess I got a little lost.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Lost_03_02": "Oh, no, boy. I think you're exactly where you're supposed to be.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_RoderichSend_15_01": "Roderich sent me.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_RoderichSend_03_02": "Roderich, huh?",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_RoderichSend_03_03": "I don't see a uniform on you, but the sergeant will certainly want to talk to you.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Roderich_Pay_What_WhatDo_NoOne_Choice": "None.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Roderich_Choice": "Roderich's.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Roderich_Pay_What_WhatDo_WithGerwin_Give_Choice": "Of course not. (Give the equipment)",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Roderich_Search_Choice": "I'm looking for Sergeant Gerwin.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Roderich_Pay_Choice": "Because he's paying me to do it.",
  "DIA_Renegade_HELLO_Roderich_Pay_What_WhatDo_WithRoderich_Choice": "I'm loyal to Roderich."
