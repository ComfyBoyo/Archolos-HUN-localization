  "DIA_ROEL_SQ119_Start_15_02": "It looks like it.",
  "DIA_ROEL_SQ119_Start_03_03": "That's what I thought. I couldn't make out your face. I suppose you're wondering how things work around here, huh?",
  "DIA_ROEL_SQ119_Start_15_04": "Actually...",
  "DIA_ROEL_SQ119_Start_03_05": "I'll give you some good advice. It's a custom here for newcomers to offer the guards some good liquor.",
  "DIA_ROEL_SQ119_Start_03_06": "Yeah, you know, to show your goodwill. These poor people have a lot of work to do. Especially now...",

  "DIA_ROEL_Atmosphere_03_02": "I'm not complaining! There's gold everywhere, nice atmosphere, and everything is watched over by well-trained mercenaries.",
  "DIA_ROEL_Atmosphere_03_03": "The rocks here are incredibly hard and split into small, sharp pieces.",
  "DIA_ROEL_Atmosphere_03_04": "The pickaxes just break after a few hours of solid splitting against those damned stones.",

  "DIA_ROEL_Atmosphere_03_06": "And don't forget to sleep regularly, or you'll collapse here from exhaustion."
