  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_FIRSTWARN_03_01": "Stop! You can't go any further!",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_FIRSTWARN_03_02": "Access to the Gold Mine is limited to its employees and designated members of the Merchant's Guild.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_SECONDWARN_03_01": "I'm warning you! One more step and you'll regret it!",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Worker_15_01": "How do I become a mine worker?",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Worker_03_02": "It's very simple, just show us your skills and sign the contract.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Skill_15_01": "How can I prove my skills?",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Skill_03_02": "A bit further down is a small cave, you'll find some miners resting there and our guards.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Skill_03_03": "Talk to Fynn, he'll assess your suitability and if he likes you, he'll sign a contract with you.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Contract_15_01": "What's in the contract?",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Contract_03_02": "First of all, you sign an agreement to share the gold mined at the mine.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Contract_03_03": "Miners have no clearly defined working hours or output requirements. As much as they mine, they earn.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Contract_03_04": "Excluding the share for the Guild, of course, but you will have to negotiate on the amount of that fee with Fynn.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_ImInGuild_15_01": "I belong to the Merchant's Guild.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_ImInGuild_03_02": "I've already told you, I only let in designated Guild members. Without a command from Lorenzo, you can only enter as a miner.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_GotContract_03_06": "All miners wear special protective gear while working. Here, here's yours.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_GotContract_15_01": "I want to go into the mine, here's my contract.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_GotContract_03_02": "You'll love it here! The entry fee will be...",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_GotContract_03_05": "What am I saying, as one of us, you get in for free!",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_GotContract_03_03": "Two hundred gold pieces.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_GotContract_03_04": "One hundred gold pieces.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Pay_Description": "I want to pay to get into the mine.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_15_01": "I want to leave the mine.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_02": "I hope the extraction went as well as you expected. Let's see what you got there.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_08": "Nothing? How did Fynn let you into our mine?",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_03": "More nuggets can be found scattered on the ground!",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_04": "Not a bad deal! When you exchange that for gold, you can certainly afford to have a nice evening in the Dark Mysteries.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_05": "Damn, I guess you had to clear out the whole mine!",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_06": "Here's your share.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_07": "Don't forget that the best rate of gold coins for nuggets you can get from our blacksmith! You can find him in the cave, near Fynn!",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_NoAraxosArmor_03_01": "One more thing. Only authorized people are allowed to wear the colors of Araxos in the mine. For that reason, I will take care of your equipment.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_NoAraxosArmor_03_02": "Don't fret, once you're done I'll give it all back to you.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_GotContract_03_09": "The only thing you are allowed to bring into the mine is your own pickaxes. All your belongings will be stored outside. You'll get them back when you're done.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_GotContract_03_10": "If you feel the need, you can also bring in your own nuggets, but be warned that you will be accounted for with each one. It's safer if you store them in a chest near the entrance.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_GotContract_03_08": "Sorry, boy, we've got a little emergency at the mine, come back later.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_MoveIt_15_01": "Get out of my way, or I'll move you myself.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_MoveIt_03_02": "Come on! Let's see you swing that pickaxe!",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Gold_15_01": "Maybe you can turn a blind eye to this...",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Gold_03_02": "Bloodwyn'll screw my head off if he finds out I let you through.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Gold_20_03_01": "Are you kidding me? I can't even get a good dinner for that.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Gold_50_03_01": "Okay, you can pass, but don't let me see you around here again or I'll be in trouble!",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_09": "Sorry, Bloodwyn has forbidden the gate to be opened until the situation with Naars is cleared up.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_10": "Bloodwyn instructed me not to let anyone pass until he himself returned to the mines.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_15_11": "Bloodwyn's not in the mine?",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_12": "Yeah, I heard he had some kind of conversation with Igor. All I saw was him running like hell into the city. Who knows what it could have been about.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_LeaveMine_03_13": "I don't want any trouble there, so I'm asking you to turn around and do some digging.",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Gold_50_Choice": "(Offer 50 nuggets)",
  "DIA_Araxos_GuardMine_Gold_20_Choice": "(Offer 20 nuggets)"
