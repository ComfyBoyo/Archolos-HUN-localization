  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_Hello_15_01": "I came on behalf of the Merchant's Guild.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_Hello_03_02": "Goodbye, then.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_WhatsWrong_15_01": "Why don't you want to cooperate?",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_WhatsWrong_03_02": "Because I don't. And you can walk away now, you can't change my mind. Better men than you have tried.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_WhatsWrong_15_03": "And have you explained to them why you don't want contracts with Araxos? If you tell us what the problem is, we'll be happy to remedy it and both parties will benefit.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_WhatsWrong_03_04": "There's nothing to explain you lousy mercenary. You and your inane buddies could finally understand that!",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_WhatsWrong_03_05": "Anything else you want? Because if that's all you're here for, you can go now.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_03_01": "Damn, that was close. It's lucky you were around, because if I'd fallen, I could have been lying here for hours!",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_15_02": "That's true. Well, then maybe we can talk about certain issue again...",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_03_03": "Eh, you're stubborn. I have nothing new to say on the matter!",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_15_04": "But we have. First of all, on behalf of the entire Guild, I want to say that we are sorry for what happened to your father...",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_03_05": "What? You went through my stuff? Thief!",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_15_06": "I'm not a thief. Please.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_03_07": "Well, you 'just borrowed', didn't you? You've fallen even lower than I thought! Why would I change my mind in a situation like this?!",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Guild_15_01": "You don't have to work for the Guild, lease is enough.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Guild_03_02": "Excuse me?",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Guild_15_03": "The guild will not commission you to do any work, instead you will be paid to tolerate the presence of mercenaries in your camp.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Guild_15_04": "Here, that's confirmation in writing.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Guild_03_05": "It looks good on paper, but how do I know that your colleagues, like you, won't be rummaging through my stuff?",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Guild_15_06": "When signing the contract you can add a point that for every stolen item you will get a multiple of its value in gold from the Guild.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Guild_03_07": "Um, with that condition... I'm willing to go along with this deal. Tell that to your boss.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Guild_15_08": "Of course. I'm glad we came to an agreement.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_15_01": "Your father warned you about a Guild that no longer exists.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_03_02": "I don't understand.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_15_03": "The Merchant's Guild board has changed, the organization now operates very differently than it did in his time. Here, a confirmation.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_03_04": "Great, and what does this paper do for me?",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_15_05": "The fact that if you join the Guild, you will not be treated the same as your father. Now Araxos takes care of its people, I can serve as an example.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_15_06": "My brother is missing and the Guild is helping me find him. If you have a problem yourself, they will also give you support.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_03_07": "I see what you mean. So what do you expect me to do?",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_15_08": "What you do now, only you'd get paid for it and have to report to the Guild and tolerate the presence of other mercenaries in the camp.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_03_09": "Do you know that if you cheat me, I'll find you and shoot you in the knee with a bow?",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_15_10": "I do now.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_03_11": "Okay, tell your boss that I tentatively agree to work for you. But I'll only give final approval if I'm happy with the content of the contract!",
  "DIA_Darthe_QA203_AfterHelp_Father_15_12": "Of course, see you soon.",
  "DIA_Darthe_QM303_Search_15_01": "Have you seen two guards in the area lately?",
  "DIA_Darthe_QM303_Search_03_02": "Not two, but I saw one running towards the old cemetery. If you care, look for him there.",
  "DIA_Darthe_Hello_03_01": "I'm Darthe, I do most of my hunting here. And no, I don't have anything to sell, I supply everything to the merchants in the city.",
  "DIA_Darthe_Ambient_03_01": "There's less and less game in the woods. It makes me anxious.",
  "DIA_Darthe_Ambient_03_02": "I have to admit, working with the Guild isn't so bad. Although I do miss the peace and quiet.",
  "DIA_Darthe_Ambient_03_03": "Before long I'll wake up with an orc axe in my head, I can feel it."
