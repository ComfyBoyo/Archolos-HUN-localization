  "DIA_Balni_Net_15_01": "I hear you can fix nets.",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_03_02": "Yes, I can. What about it?",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_15_03": "I have one here that's shredded. Could you fix it for me?",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_03_04": "I don't have time right now, I'm going fishing. Come back when I'm done.",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_15_05": "It's just that I'm pressed for time...",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_03_06": "Me too, young man. Come later.",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Story_15_01": "I hear you like stories.",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Story_03_02": "It's true, I never refuse an interesting story. I always work quicker with them, complete silence makes me feel bad since my days in the navy.",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Story_15_03": "So fast that you could fix the net without delaying the catch?",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Story_03_04": "Well, to work that fast, the story would have to be really good, but I don't deny that it's possible.",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Gold_15_01": "And for a few gold pieces you'll do it now?",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Gold_03_02": "Are you trying to bribe me? No way! I won't be tempted by something as primitive as gold!",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Gold_15_03": "Are you sure?",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Gold_03_04": "Yes, young man! What kind of generation is this to suggest such things to an old veteran! Get out of my sight, I never want to see you again!",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Gold_15_05": "But...",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Gold_03_06": "Out!",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Fish_15_01": "How many fish do you usually catch when fishing?",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Fish_03_02": "It depends. Sometimes none, sometimes 20. There is no proven recipe for a successful catch, sea animals are too capricious for that.",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Fish_15_03": "How about I compensate you for the delay in fishing? I've got some fish on me, I can give them to you.",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Fish_03_04": "And I'm supposed to fix your net in return? Hm, actually, that sounds reasonable.",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Later_15_01": "Okay, I'll come later.",
  "DIA_Balni_Net_Later_03_02": "I'm glad you understand.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Result_03_01": "It's been a real pleasure listening to you, kid. Here, I fixed this net. It should be completely usable.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Result_15_02": "Thanks. I won't bother you anymore.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Result_03_03": "Let me tell you, kid, I wasn't bought by your story. Here, your net. I haven't had time to fix it, and I won't. I'm sorry.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_15_01": "Ready for a story?",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_03_02": "Sure, just give me that net before you start.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_15_03": "Yeah, take it.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_03_04": "I'm all ears.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Picnic_15_01": "One time I went to a festival.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Picnic_15_02": "My brother Jorn was with me. At first we wandered a bit between the stalls, looking for familiar people, that sort of thing.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Picnic_15_03": "Eventually we sat down at this long table and bought each other a beer.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Picnic_03_04": "Just one?",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Picnic_15_05": "Well, at first we just wanted a cultural taste!",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Picnic_03_06": "Aha.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Cartographer_15_01": "I once went to a cartographer with my brother.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Cartographer_03_02": "Fascinating. Cartographic workshops are very interesting places.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Cartographer_15_03": "In this case it was just so. First, we talked for a while with the owner, an old buffoon who seemed to remember the creation of the kingdom of Myrtana.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Cartographer_15_04": "He stank of sweat, because despite the hot weather he still wore the most elegant clothes he had, the ones with fur.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Cartographer_03_05": "Mmmm.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Dragon_15_01": "I saw a dragon once.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Dragon_03_02": "What? Dragons don't exist!",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Dragon_15_03": "I'm telling the truth...",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Dragon_03_04": "Go away with that truth! Take the net and don't bother me anymore!",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Orc_15_01": "Besides us, there was a tamed orc.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Orc_03_02": "A tame orc? These beasts cannot be tamed!",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Veteran_15_01": "Besides us, there was an old war veteran.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Veteran_03_02": "How did you know he was a veteran?",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Veteran_15_03": "We lived in a small settlement, everyone knew everyone. His name was Grond and he had no left leg, which made it hard for him to find any work.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Veteran_15_04": "So that he wouldn't sit there so miserable, we decided to give him some coins.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Veteran_15_05": "Overjoyed, he bought himself some food with it, and a special one at that, which is prepared only on the occasion of such festivals.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Veteran_03_06": "Aha.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Paladin_15_01": "Besides us, there was a paladin.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Paladin_03_02": "Paladin? Where are you from?",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Paladin_15_03": "From Londram.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Paladin_03_04": "A paladin in such a small town?",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Paladin_15_05": "I don't know what he was doing there. All I know is that at that very moment he was looking for a map, but he couldn't find it.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Paladin_15_06": "He was in a lot of trouble, but I helped him.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Sword_15_01": "It wasn't long before we got a pretty decent sword from him.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Sword_03_03": "Yeah, I can already see getting a decent sword from someone like that.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Sword_15_04": "What's so strange about that?",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Sword_03_05": "Everything. Young man, you didn't do a very good job with that story, I didn't have time to fix your net. Take it and don't bother me anymore.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Dead_15_01": "He died a short time later.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Dead_03_02": "That's too bad. What happened?",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Dead_15_03": "Of old age. Healer said he didn't suffer.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Dead_03_04": "At least that's that.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_OrcAttack_15_01": "Soon after, the village was invaded by orcs...",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_OrcAttack_03_02": "What? If the village was invaded by orcs, you'd be dead by now!",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_OrcAttack_15_03": "I ran away from them.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_OrcAttack_03_04": "Yeah, sure, you're just making it up. Get that net, I'm not wasting my time on this now!",
  "DIA_Balni_Fish_15_01": "Here, fish for you.",
  "DIA_Balni_Fish_03_02": "Thank you very much. As agreed, I'll fix your net. Give it to me.",
  "DIA_Balni_Fish_15_03": "Here.",
  "DIA_Balni_FishNetDone_03_01": "Good, it should be all right.",
  "DIA_Balni_FishNetDone_15_02": "Thanks, and bye.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Picnic_Veteran_Sword_Choice": "It wasn't long before we got a decent sword from him.",
  "DIA_Balni_StoryTime_Picnic_Veteran_OrcAttack_Choice": "Soon after, the village was invaded by orcs."
