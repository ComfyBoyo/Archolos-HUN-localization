  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_YieldToNone_03_02": "Is it so strange that a man tries to prepare his rest?",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_WhoAreYou_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_WhoAreYou_03_02": "My name is Fane and I'm... well... who am I?",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_WhoAreYou_03_03": "Actually, I don't really remember who I was when I was alive... But I guess i-it doesn't really matter now...",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_WhatAreUDoin_15_01": "What are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_WhatAreUDoin_03_02": "I think it's obvious! I'm trying to leave my body... or at least what's left of it.",

  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_AnotherSkeletons_03_04": "As you can see, I don't even own a weapon. Besides... it's not in my nature to go after strangers like this.",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_RattleMeBones_15_01": "You're on your own.",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_RattleMeBones_15_02": "Just watch out for the wolves, you look like the perfect snack.",

  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_MarvinFighter_15_01": "Occasionally, I'll smack a mouth or two.",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_MarvinFighter_03_02": "You say?",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_MarvinFighter_03_03": "Well, all right, I won't judge a book by its cover.",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_MarvinFighter_03_04": "Show me what you got! Hit me as hard as you can.",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_Dissapointed_03_01": "I might have expected that... I guess there's nothing left to do but look for another solution.",

  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_WhatCouldHelp_03_05": "Do you think if I had any idea, I'd be lying in that ditch?",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_WhatCouldHelp_03_06": "Of course not! I think I've tried everything!",
  "DIA_Fane_SQ113_WhatCouldHelp_03_07": "I'm going back to my grave. Wake me up when you figure something out.",

  "DIA_Fane_Q509_Vardhal_03_02": "Volfzack? For some reason that name sounds familiar...",
  "DIA_Fane_Q509_Vardhal_15_03": "It's a dangerous tomb, full of cursed undead. Your 'gift' could be very useful there.",
  "DIA_Fane_Q509_Vardhal_03_04": "A dangerous tomb? Maybe I'll finally die there!",
  "DIA_Fane_Q509_Vardhal_03_05": "An undead shaking off a curse in a place full of cursed undead, that sounds poetic...",
  "DIA_Fane_Q509_Vardhal_03_06": "Well... I'll see where this place is and meet you there!",
  "DIA_Fane_Q509_OnMyWay_03_01": "Sorry, I'll have to think carefully about the route I take...",
  "DIA_Fane_Q509_OnMyWay_03_02": "I'd rather avoid awkward confrontations with scared people."
