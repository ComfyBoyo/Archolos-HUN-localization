  "DIA_Knut_Welcome_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Knut_Welcome_03_02": "My name is Knut, and as you can see, I am a woodcutter.",
  "DIA_Knut_Welcome_03_03": "I'm a busy man, so talk, what do you want?",
  "DIA_Knut_HowsWorkGoing_15_01": "How's the work going?",
  "DIA_Knut_HowsWorkGoing_03_02": "The wood is hard and the trees have deep roots. It's like they're getting ready for winter.",
  "DIA_Knut_HowsWorkGoing_03_03": "Other than that, pretty good. Of course, if no one bothers us and asks stupid questions.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_15_01": "Do you have any wood to spare?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_03_02": "If you're asking if my inventory is for sale, I have to disappoint you, but I don't sell wood to just anyone.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_03_03": "And even if you did, you're late.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_03_04": "The ruler of this stronghold bought the entire last batch from us and has just ordered another one.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Village_15_01": "The residents of Silbach urgently need a supply of wood to repair their huts.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Village_03_02": "I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I have already been promised the full amount for all the wood.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_15_01": "Maybe I'll earn that wood then?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_03_02": "I see you've got hands like a real woodcutter. Maybe you'll be of some use.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_03_04": "Do you know how it's done?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_15_05": "My brother used to show me.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_03_06": "Good. Well, at least I won't have to waste my time and my tongue.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_03_07": "Cut each of the prepared logs into equal slices, then bring me all the wood.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_03_08": "Once you've done that, you get your share.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_03_09": "Looking at you, you'd sooner cut your fingers off than help me with my work.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_03_10": "Let's think...",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_03_11": "Elco, one of my men, has not returned to camp for several days.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_03_12": "He's always been a klutz and I've seen him lazying more often than working, but with the amount of work we've been having lately, I could use more people.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Work_03_13": "Find him and tell him to get back to work. And if you find his dead body, so much the better. At least there'll be fewer to feed.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Look_15_01": "How do I recognize him?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Look_03_02": "Short hair, short beard, skinny as a pike.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Look_03_03": "He had a huge mole on his cheek.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Where_15_01": "Any idea where I should look for it?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Where_03_02": "He usually liked to hang out near the lake south of here. Look for him there.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Where_03_03": "Maybe he's just lazing around as usual or some wild beast has eaten him.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Allright_15_01": "I'll try to find him.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Allright_03_02": "Once you find out what happened to him, come back to me and you'll get some wood.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Lord_15_01": "Who is the ruler of this fortress?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Lord_03_02": "His name is Ulryk. I don't know much about him, and frankly, I don't much care who he is.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Lord_03_03": "The important thing is that he pays more than the city's governor.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_WoodForYou_03_01": "You did your part, so you'll get the wood as promised.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_WoodForYou_03_02": "How many pieces do you need?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_WoodForYou_15_03": "Twenty is enough.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_WoodForYou_03_04": "Take it, hope you can handle the transport.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_15_01": "Please, this is all the wood I was able to collect.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_03_02": "Not bad, boy. You still need to work on your accuracy, but you did a good job nonetheless.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_03_03": "You did well, come back to me in a while and there will certainly be more work to do.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_03_04": "You would make a good a woodcutter, boy! I have a proposition for you.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_03_05": "I'll keep your day's pay, but you'll get a woodcutter's outfit instead.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_03_06": "Very comfortable to work with, and can also protect you from the fangs of those damned wolves.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_03_07": "What do you say?",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_03_08": "Fair pay for fair work. Here.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_NoThanks_15_01": "I think I prefer the paycheck though.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_NoThanks_03_02": "Suit yourself! If you change your mind though, you can buy it from me at any time at the same price.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_GiveMe_15_01": "Sounds like a reasonable offer.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_GiveMe_03_02": "Because that's what it is! Glad to welcome you to our little group.",
  "DIA_Knut_WoodForYou_GiveMe_03_03": "Come to me regularly, saw properly, and you won't run out of coins.",
  "DIA_Knut_BuyArmor_15_01": "I would like to buy the woodcutter's outfit.",
  "DIA_Knut_BuyArmor_03_02": "I knew you'd come to your senses, boy.",
  "DIA_Knut_BuyArmor_03_03": "Glad to welcome you to our little group.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_15_01": "I think I managed to find Elco.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_03_02": "Really? Where's this slacker?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_15_03": "In the charcoal burners' camp.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_03_04": "Dirty bastard. By the way, I'm gonna talk to Helmud about stealing my people.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_Coal_15_01": "In the charcoal burners' camp and it looks like he's not going to move from there.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_Coal_03_02": "Dirty bastard. I'll personally beat running away out of his head. I'll also talk to Helmud about stealing my men.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_Dead_15_01": "He's dead.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_Dead_03_02": "Too bad for the boy, but on the other hand, I won't have to worry about him anymore.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_Dead_15_03": "I found this amulet on him.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_Dead_03_04": "Indeed, I remember that it belonged to him.",
  "DIA_Knut_Work_15_01": "Need help with your work?",
  "DIA_Knut_Work_03_02": "From what I remember, you did pretty well last time.",
  "DIA_Knut_Work_03_03": "As before, cut each of the prepared logs into even slices.",
  "DIA_Knut_Work_03_04": "Once you've done that, bring them to me, you'll get some coins in return.",
  "DIA_Knut_Work_03_05": "Come back in a while, maybe I'll find something else for you.",
  "DIA_Knut_Work_03_06": "We can always use a little help. From what I remember, you did pretty well last time.",
  "DIA_Knut_Work_03_07": "Thanks, boy, but I don't have any new orders for you right now.",
  "DIA_Knut_Work_03_08": "Get back to me in a few days, then maybe something will pop up.",
  "DIA_Knut_Work_03_09": "Come back when you've gained more strength.",
  "DIA_Knut_Work_03_10": "You've made your quota for the next few days. For now, no more of our orders.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_03_01": "Yes, but you can put the saw down this time because you won't need it.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_03_02": "Lately we've been hearing wolfs howling more and more in the area.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_03_03": "It looks like the beasts have made their den somewhere, and I don't mean that old piece of brick on the other side of the lake.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_03_04": "A few days ago, a hunter came to us, supposedly the best in the whole city. He took an interest in the whole situation.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_03_05": "I don't trust townspeople, and someone like him even less, but I want my people to be able to work in peace.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_03_06": "Keep an eye on this city bum to make sure he's doing his job right. You might learn a few tricks from him in the process.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_Alright_15_01": "All right, I'll help you.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_Alright_03_02": "The hunter should be waiting for you at night near the old shrine, just below the rock arch. You will find it to the west of the camp.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_Alright_03_03": "I told him I'd send someone to help, but don't wait too long. He won't be standing there forever.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_Reward_15_01": "Hunting wolves is not the same as cutting wood. What do I get in return?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_Reward_03_02": "Don't worry about the money. You can expect several pays for a job like this.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_Why_15_01": "Why don't you take care of it yourself?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_Why_03_02": "You think I'm a coward?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Start_Why_03_03": "Someone has to keep an eye on the work here at camp. Besides, if I'm not mistaken, you're the one looking for work.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Finish_03_01": "So you're back.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Finish_03_02": "How did the hunt go?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Finish_15_03": "Wolves won't be a problem for you anymore.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Finish_03_04": "Good! You seem to have slaughtered a whole pack of these beasts.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ204_Finish_03_05": "And here's the promised gold.",
  "DIA_Knut_City_15_01": "Hello Knut, I have an unusual request for you.",
  "DIA_Knut_City_03_02": "Make it quick, boy, the job won't supervise itself.",
  "DIA_Knut_City_15_03": "I need to get into the city, could you help me with that somehow?",
  "DIA_Knut_City_03_04": "Admittedly, we have an order from Ulryk, but it won't last forever.",
  "DIA_Knut_City_03_05": "I have to think about the future of my work, and with the war at sea going on, the shipyard seems like a good potential customer.",
  "DIA_Knut_City_03_06": "They used to make me several offers, but none of them seemed right.",
  "DIA_Knut_City_03_07": "Pay them a visit and see how much they are now willing to pay for my exquisite wood.",
  "DIA_Knut_City_03_08": "Here's a letter with my offer, the guards at the gate shouldn't give you any trouble.",
  "DIA_Knut_City_03_10": "You barely got hired here, and already you want to run away to the city?",
  "DIA_Knut_City_03_11": "Work a little longer and we'll get back to this issue.",
  "DIA_Knut_City_03_12": "At this point, every pair of hands with the saw is priceless to me.",
  "DIA_Knut_Q401Help_15_01": "I need the help of one of your men.",
  "DIA_Knut_Q401Help_03_08": "Who? Do you see any other people here? I don't! All corpses!",
  "DIA_Knut_Q401Help_03_09": "Bloody snappers! But of course both the guard and the Wolf Sons have better things to do than watch over us!",
  "DIA_Knut_Q401Help_03_10": "Give me a minute, I need to pull myself together...",
  "DIA_Knut_Q401Help_03_02": "Well, ask them. They know the rules, they have to get me the right amount of wood at the right time, and what they do after hours is their business.",
  "DIA_Knut_Q401Help_03_03": "The question is, with those crazy snappers, will anyone want to move outside the camp?",
  "DIA_Knut_Q401Help_15_04": "We'll see. Who do you think could muster such courage?",
  "DIA_Knut_Q401Help_03_07": "Now that those damn things have bitten Lowell to death... I don't think anybody could. But you can try.",
  "DIA_Knut_Q401Help_03_05": "I don't know. How about Lowell? He's always been one of the tougher ones.",
  "DIA_Knut_Q401Help_15_06": "Thanks for your help.",
  "DIA_Knut_Canyoutrain_15_00": "Could you show me how to get stronger?",
  "DIA_Knut_Canyoutrain_03_01": "Certainly not for free, and certainly not if you're a weakling. I'm not wasting my time on someone who can't lift a log.",
  "DIA_Knut_Train_15_00": "Show me how to become stronger.",
  "DIA_Knut_Train_03_01": "When you pull out the gold, we'll talk.",
  "DIA_Knut_Train_Back_03_00": "You already know something, but you could still do more.",
  "DIA_Knut_Train_Back_03_01": "You got a strong arm. I can't show you anything else.",
  "DIA_Knut_Train_STR1_13_00": "I wouldn't lift a finger for something like that.",
  "DIA_Knut_Train_STR1_13_01": "Wave the axe around a bit, get some strength, and I'll get to you.",
  "DIA_Knut_Train_STR5_13_00": "Hello, this is not what we agreed to. Bring more.",
  "DIA_Knut_Train_STR5_13_01": "I told you, I don't teach weaklings.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ404_WoodcutterArmor_15_01": "I need your work outfit.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ404_WoodcutterArmor_03_02": "You should have the one I gave you a while back!",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ404_WoodcutterArmor_15_03": "Somehow it got lost.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ404_WoodcutterArmor_03_05": "I may have something for sale, but not in the best condition.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ404_WoodcutterArmor_03_04": "You know the rules. Get to work, and when you're done, we'll get back to this conversation.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ404_GotYourWood_03_01": "Good job, man. All right, I'll give you our clothes.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ404_GotYourWood_03_02": "You earned them honestly. Like I said, they're not the freshest...",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ404_GotYourWood_15_03": "All the better. Thank you for everything.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ404_Saw_15_01": "Have you ever seen men working on a crane?",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ404_Saw_03_02": "They came here a while ago, did some work, and then I didn't see them again. Maybe they just gave up? It's a shame, I was hoping we could use it to haul wood.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ406_Offer_15_01": "I have an interesting job offer for you.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ406_Offer_03_02": "That's a good thing, because our work for Ulryk is coming to an end. As soon as we transport these huge logs of wood, we'll be off.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ406_Offer_15_03": "What does Ulryk need these logs for?",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ406_Offer_03_04": "Customer orders, customer gets. None of my business. So what about this job?",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ406_Offer_15_05": "The city shipyard needs good people. Right now they're all slacking off.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ406_Offer_03_06": "No right man in the right place. What are the conditions?",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ406_Offer_15_07": "That's something you'll have to settle with Grayson, the Royal Envoy.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ406_Offer_03_08": "Working for the kingdom. It can actually be profitable.",
  "DIA_Knut_KQ406_Offer_03_09": "All right. I'll visit your 'excellency' soon to discuss everything thoroughly.",
  "DIA_Knut_Q505_Help_15_01": "Don't you have any surplus solid wood?",
  "DIA_Knut_Q505_Help_03_02": "There is a lot of manufacturing waste coming into the yard that is great for making bows or other items.",
  "DIA_Knut_Q505_Help_03_03": "I had the workers put the best pieces in a crate next to this ship under construction.",
  "DIA_Knut_Q505_Help_03_04": "Look inside and get what you need. After all, you're the reason I have this job!",
  "DIA_Knut_Q505_Help_03_05": "I think we could find something... but it's going to cost money, too.",
  "DIA_Knut_Q505_Help_03_06": "You don't even know how much Frida gives me for decent bow material.",
  "DIA_Knut_Q505_Pay_Description": "(Pay 300 GP for wood)",
  "DIA_Knut_Q505_Pay_03_01": "It's a decent wood, you'll make an excellent bow or crossbow out of it!",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_Wood_Village_Choice": "The residents of Silbach are in urgent need of supplies.",
  "DIA_Knut_SQ101_FoundNirko_Dead_Choice": "He's dead (Lie)."
