  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Start_15_01": "What are you doing with that cannon?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Start_03_02": "I'm pushing it, don't you see?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Start_15_03": "That I know, but why and where are you pushing it?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Start_03_04": "Can't you see I can barely breathe? Help me push it, and I'll tell you all about it.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Start_Yes_15_01": "Step back, I'll show you how it's done.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Start_No_15_01": "I don't have time right now.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Start_No_03_02": "I'll probably go on for a while, if you change your mind, get back to me.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_TakeQuest_15_01": "I changed my mind. I'll help you with the cannon.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_03_01": "Okay, we're there. Thanks for your help, by the way, I'm Berter.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_03_02": "I saw you during the tournament, not a bad performance.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_15_03": "Thanks.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_15_04": "Tell me, why did we push the cannon all the way out here?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_03_05": "A long story, I live in a hut with my buddy Saul. Some time ago he made up his mind to play all sorts of stupid jokes on me.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_03_06": "At first it was even funny, clipped my chair leg, tossed a dead rat on the bed. But then he started to seriously overreact.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_03_07": "When I was on the hunt, he had add some nasty stuff to the cauldron, because after dinner my stomach started to boil so much that I prayed to Adanos for strength.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_03_08": "I told him that I don't feel like playing these childish games, but since he likes it, I'll show him how to have fun.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_What_15_01": "What are you going to do?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_What_03_02": "Since the tournament, Saul has been walking around hunched over and complaining about his head cracking.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_What_03_03": "We'll wake him up with a little noise. When he hears bang of a shot and a cannonball flies over his head, it won't be so funny anymore.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_What_03_04": "We already have a cannon, would you go back to the pier for some more cannonballs? Aaand... Take some torch with you.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_NeedCanonball_What_15_05": "I'll be right back.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Canonballs_15_01": "I have cannonballs and torches.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Canonballs_03_02": "Great, then we can proceed.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Canonballs_03_03": "Take the torches and do the honors.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Canonballs_15_04": "Wait, what about cannoball?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Canonballs_03_05": "You know... it turns out one was already in the barrel... But if things don't work out, we always have a spare!",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Sure_15_01": "Are you sure this is a good idea?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Sure_03_02": "What might happen? I aimed above him. At most the hut will shatter slightly, a few boards and it will be as good as new.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Sure_03_03": "I'm willing to make that sacrifice for the sake peace of mind.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Sure_Talk_15_01": "Maybe you should talk to him?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Sure_Talk_03_02": "You talk like a woman! Should I cry on his shoulder and ask him to stop? I'd have the whole Harbour laughing at me.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Sure_Mad_15_01": "Actually, Saul got under my skin, too.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Sure_Mad_03_02": "See! Two birds with one shot!",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_03_01": "By Beliar!",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_15_02": "You said you aimed above him!",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_03_03": "I thought so! How was I supposed to know how the cannonball would fly, I've never fired something like that!",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_15_04": "You have never fired a cannon and decided to try it for the first time by aiming at another human?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_03_05": "How was I supposed to know it's so hard?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_03_06": "Here's what we'll do, if anyone asks, you'll say Saul did it to himself.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_15_07": "You want to tell everyone in the Harbor that Saul shot himself with a cannon?",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_03_08": "People know he was a weasel and had these weird joke ideas of his, we'll just pretend it's one of them.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_03_09": "I'll give you everything I got on my last hunt!",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_Yes_15_01": "It's okay, I'm not gonna turn you in.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_Yes_15_02": "I wasn't too fond of Saul anyway.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_Yes_03_03": "Thanks my friend.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_No_15_01": "Cortez will find out.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_WhatTheFuck_No_03_02": "You damned rat! It's your fault, you should have warned me!",
  "DIA_Berter_Ambient_15_00": "How are you doing?",
  "DIA_Berter_Ambient_13_01": "It's not bad. If it works out for me with this cannon, it'll be even better!",
  "DIA_Berter_Ambient_13_02": "Leave me alone!",
  "DIA_Berter_Ambient_13_03": "I can't stop thinking about what we've done, but overall I'm fine somehow.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Start_No_Choice": "I don't have time right now.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Start_Yes_Choice": "Step back, I'll show you how it's done.",
  "DIA_Berter_SQ408_Sure_Mad_Choice": "Actually, Saul got under my skin, too."
