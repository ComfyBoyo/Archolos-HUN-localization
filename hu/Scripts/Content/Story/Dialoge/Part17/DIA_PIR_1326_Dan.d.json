  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_15_01": "I've heard I can have a duel with you.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_13_02": "Hey, kid, slow down! Why don't you introduce yourself first? Tell me, what are you doing here? And why do you want to get beat up by me?",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_15_01": "I challenge you to a duel. Would you refuse an offer to swing such a weakling?",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_13_02": "Well, I'll admit, it's nice to beat somebody black and blue.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_13_03": "Hahaha. You made me laugh. I heard you punched a few people in the Harbour before...",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_13_04": "Let me know when you're ready. You need to be shown what the laws are here.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BeatYourMug_15_01": "We'll see who get punch in the face.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BeatYourMug_13_02": "Oho! You're a valiant boy! Good, I like to teach them about life!",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_EarnRespect_15_01": "I want to earn respect.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_EarnRespect_13_02": "Well, you've set yourself a difficult goal. Are you sure you wouldn't rather do something simpler? Like kill a troll?",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_IAmMarvin_15_01": "I'm Marvin.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_IAmMarvin_13_02": "Well, no one chose their own name.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_IHaveToPrepare_15_01": "I have to get ready.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_IHaveToPrepare_13_02": "I understand, change your pants. Ha! Go ahead, I'll wait.",
  "DIA_Dan_Guide_13_02": "Okay, follow me.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_WeCanStart_15_01": "We're good to go.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_WeCanStart_13_02": "Your will. Let's dance.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_Shooting_15_01": "I'd like to test myself with you in shooting.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_Shooting_13_02": "Oh, now I see why you're so lewd! Because you're not in danger of breaking anything!",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelProposal_BothAfter_Shooting_13_03": "I like to shoot too, but that would be too easy. Besides... I really feel like punching someone.",
  "DIA_Dan_Guide_15_01": "I'm ready.",
  "DIA_Dan_Duel_13_01": "Well, show me what you've learned.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelAfter_13_01": "Hehe, what? Still so sure of yourself?",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelAfter_15_02": "Okay, leave me alone.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelAfter_13_03": "Hahaha!",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelAfter_13_04": "Oh, brother! I've never seen anything like it... where did you learn it?",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelAfter_15_05": "Here and there. Thanks for the nice training.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelAfter_13_06": "Damn, I'll be talking about this for a month! Or longer!",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelRevenge_15_01": "I want a rematch.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelRevenge_13_02": "Haven't you had enough? Kid, don't waste my time.",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelRevenge_15_03": "You refuse to fight? I think someone here is scared...",
  "DIA_Dan_DuelRevenge_13_05": "Watch your mouth, turd.",
  "DIA_Dan_Ambient_03_01": "Kid, don't bother me, some people are busy. Get yourself a job.",
  "DIA_Dan_Ambient_03_02": "You want another punch in the face? Just say the word, I'll be glad to warm up.",
  "DIA_Dan_Ambient_03_03": "Unfortunately, I have to admit, you taught me an important lesson. But I'll practice a little and I'll hit you someday, you'll see.",
  "DIA_Dan_Hello_15_00": "What do you do here?",
  "DIA_Dan_Hello_13_01": "The necessary things themselves, like making sure youngsters like you don't annoy anyone too much.",
  "DIA_Dan_Hello_15_02": "O... and how do you do that?",
  "DIA_Dan_Hello_13_03": "Do you want to see?",
  "DIA_Dan_Canyoutrain_15_00": "If you're so tough, maybe you could train me?",
  "DIA_Dan_Canyoutrain_13_01": "And what makes you think I'd want to train a self-important jerk like you?",
  "DIA_Dan_Canyoutrain_15_02": "Come on, what else do you have to do?",
  "DIA_Dan_Canyoutrain_13_03": "Like beating the shit out of a turd like you. It's quite a relaxing activity.",
  "DIA_Dan_Canyoutrain_15_04": "What if you made a few coins in the process?",
  "DIA_Dan_Canyoutrain_13_05": "That's different. For a few coins, I could tell anyone a thing or two about heavy weapons, crossbow shooting, or gaining strength.",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_15_00": "Let's start training.",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_03_01": "This is going to be interesting. Just don't trip over your own feet! And get the gold ready!",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_Back_03_00": "Not bad, you're not quite as stupid as you look.",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_Back_03_01": "I guess that would be it. There is no need for you to know more.",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_Back_15_02": "No need? Or can't you teach me any more?",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_Back_03_03": "Don't be arrogant, scumbag! This is the end of our training, and that's all!",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_CR1_13_01": "Having trouble counting? Bring more coins!",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_CR5_13_01": "You got a hole in your pocket? Cause I think you got some gold stashed away somewhere.",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_2H1_13_01": "I'm too kind to you anyway, and you're still trying to skimp on my training?",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_2H5_13_01": "Look, living here isn't cheap. I'm not going to waste my time for that amount.",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_STR1_13_00": "For that much, you can learn from some mister in town, but not from me!",
  "DIA_Dan_Train_STR5_13_00": "Try offering me that much again and we'll talk differently!",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_03_01": "I heard what you did with Ben. Well, it's impressive. Until now, no one had the guts to stand up to him.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_03_02": "Tell me, what's your secret? You don't look like much of a killer.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Tell_15_01": "I can tell you...",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Tell_15_02": "...but only if you promise not to tell anyone.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Tell_03_03": "Well, I think it's obvious, you have my word.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Secret_15_01": "I drink enhancing potions regularly. They increase strength and stamina without the need for a long training.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Secret_15_02": "They are expensive, but the results are amazing. I happen to have one with me. Maybe you'd like to try it out?",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Secret_03_03": "I've never used anything like this before. Is there a risk of any side effects?",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Secret_15_04": "I drink it regularly and nothing has happened to me yet. I don't think there's anything to worry about.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Secret_03_05": "All right, give it!",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Transform_L_03_01": "Ugh! It tastes disgusting, but I feels somehow stronger. If you have a few more of these, bring them to me.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Transform_L_15_02": "Sure, I'll remember.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Transform_M_03_01": "What is this disgusting stuff? Drink the awful stuff yourself, I'll stick with my regular training.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Transform_H_03_01": "I feel my whole body is filling up with energy. Now I could rip anyone apart!",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Transform_H_03_02": "My skin... Is it normal for it to start itching? Agh! Aah!!!",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Monster_03_02": "Damn it, what had happened to me? I knew that messing around with magic and potions was not a good idea.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Monster_03_03": "You gotta turn this around somehow, Marvin. I don't want to spend the rest of my life like this.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Monster_15_04": "I'll try to think of something. In the meantime, maybe it's best not to show your face like that to anyone. You never know how someone might react to seeing you.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Monster_03_05": "I'll be waiting here, but hurry up.",
  "DIA_DanTournamentFight_13_01": "It's called a duel! Where did you learn to fight like that?",
  "DIA_DanTournamentFight_End_13_01": "I'll have to try out some of your moves in an upcoming trening.",
  "DIA_DanTournamentFight_End2_13_01": "Take it easy, buddy! You're easier to irritate than Big Ben when he's out of beer!",
  "DIA_DanTournamentFight_MIL_15_01": "For a city guard, it's daily bread.",
  "DIA_DanTournamentFight_SLD_15_01": "You know, sometimes Merchant's Guild contracts involve a little more than delivering goods.",
  "DIA_DanTournamentFight_Badass_15_01": "I happen to punch a few scabby mouths from time to time.",
  "DIA_DanTournamentFight_NotYourBusiness_15_01": "It's none of your business.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Tell_Choice": "I will tell you if you promise not to tell anyone.",
  "DIA_Dan_SQ406_Potion_Tell_Secret_Choice": "I drink strength potions regularly.",
  "DIA_DanTournamentFightComment_SLD_Choice": "Merchant's Guild contracts involve more than the delivery of goods."
