  "DIA_Simon_Stan_RodrigoInterrupt_13_01": "Okay kid, you're asking too many questions lately.",
  "DIA_Simon_Stan_RodrigoInterrupt_13_02": "Believe me, it's better for you to leave Rodrigo alone now.",
  "DIA_Simon_Stan_RodrigoInterrupt_13_03": "Go to the tavern, drink some beer, order yourself a lady and de-stress a bit, because with this attitude someone will quickly gut you here.",
  "DIA_Simon_Stan_RodrigoInterrupt_13_04": "Also, maybe you'll come up with some meaningful leads rather than just listening to the mob.",
  "DIA_Simon_Stan_RodrigoInterrupt_13_05": "You'll help Rodrigo the best if you just get out of here. Go to the tavern, have a beer, order yourself a lady and de-stress a bit.",
  "DIA_Simon_Stan_RodrigoInterrupt_13_06": "Maybe then you'll come up with some meaningful leads rather than just listening to the mob.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_15_00": "What's that supposed to mean?",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_03_01": "I've wanted to talk to you without witnesses for some time now. And most of all, without Rodrigo finding out about it.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_03_02": "Look, I know Cortez told you to find Stan's killer, but it's not Rodrigo.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_03_03": "I know him well, he may have had a run-in with that drunk, but trust me. That's not him.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_15_00": "What happened between Stan and Rodrigo?",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_03_01": "It was pouring terribly that day. There was nothing to do, so Cortez gave us the day off.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_03_02": "We went to the tavern, but there wasn't much going on there either. Rodrigo tried to keep himself occupied somehow. He saw that Fox and Stan had come up with some activity.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_03_03": "Meatbug racing, as if the day wasn't boring enough. But since Rodrigo likes gambling, he decided to take part in the betting.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_03_04": "He did well at first, but then he started losing.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_03_05": "This seemed rather suspicious, so Rodrigo started a brawl. It turned out that Stan had started giving one of the meatbugs a speed potion.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_03_06": "As far as I'm concerned it's a waste of a good potion. However, Rodrigo is allergic to cheating and just gave Stan a whack.",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHappened_15_00": "He reportedly threatened Stan with death.",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHappened_03_01": "People make threats when they're drunk. If everyone did their part, we'd all be in Beliar's kingdom long ago.",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHappened_2_15_00": "Why was Rodrigo so upset?",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHappened_2_03_01": "As far as I know, he lost a lot of money on that bet, but how much, I don't know. Rodrigo, although cheerful, doesn't talk much about himself.",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHappened_2_03_02": "He writes his thoughts in a journal. He always keeps it locked in his chest.",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHappened_2_03_03": "Unfortunately... getting that key isn't so easy. Rodrigo won't part with it.",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHappened_2_03_04": "You can try to steal it from him, or you can use a lock pick to open the chest. Just be warned, the lock looks very solid.",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHappened_2_03_05": "Just remember, you better not let anyone see you do it.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_3_15_00": "Why don't you want Rodrigo to know about our meeting?",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_3_03_01": "He is extremely proud and doesn't like anyone meddling in his affairs.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_3_03_02": "He thinks that since he is innocent, he will not explain himself.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_3_03_03": "Okay, that's all I wanted to talk about. Now get out. It's better that no one sees us leaving together.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_3_15_04": "Thanks for the information. I hope it will help me discover the truth.",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_Cortez_15_00": "So Cortez didn't pay for this?",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_Cortez_03_01": "Of course not! They said you were pretty smart...",
  "DIA_Simon_SecretInfo_Cortez_03_02": "Well, the important thing is that we got to meet.",
  "DIA_Simon_House_15_00": "Who owns this house?",
  "DIA_Simon_House_13_01": "Cortez, our boss. I advise you well, if you value your life, don't upset him!",
  "DIA_Simon_Whoareyou_15_10": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Simon_Whoareyou_13_11": "What do you care? I'm Simon.",
  "DIA_Simon_Whoareyou_15_12": "I don't think you like people.",
  "DIA_Simon_Whoareyou_13_13": "I don't like the kind who have nothing to do and bother others. Anything else?",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_15_01": "Cortez must be informed of everything.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_03_02": "You know what he'll do to me if I give him news like that?",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_15_03": "Tell him I sent you. Tell him what happened. And let him know I'm trying to salvage what I can.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_15_04": "With any luck, the sea will throw up some crates. I'll look for them, as well as the survivors.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_03_05": "Be that as it may, but I would advise you not to come back until you have something concrete.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_03_06": "Do you even know what happened? Beckett won't tell me. How did the ship go down?",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_Yes_15_01": "I know. I'll tell Cortez everything later.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_Yes_03_02": "I don't know what you're hiding, but this is not going to end well for you.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_No_15_01": "He didn't tell me either. We'll deal with it later.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_No_03_02": "Beckett's on to something. If you're gonna lie to the boss, I suggest you stay out of here.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_GoldChest_15_01": "I found something.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_GoldChest_03_02": "That's good, because Cortez is furious! So furious that one wrong word and he'll chop both of us to pieces.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_GoldChest_15_03": "In the swamp someone tried to drag a large chest of gold. I still have some work to do, but if someone doesn't stand by it, I'm afraid that sooner or later someone will steal it from us.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_GoldChest_03_04": "Are you sure it came from the transport?",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_GoldChest_15_05": "Where else? A chest bursting with gold magically appeared in the middle of the swamp.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_GoldChest_03_06": "All right, let's go.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_WhereGoldChest_Whistle_03_03": "Well, let's move on.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_WhereGoldChest_03_01": "Well, where's the chest?",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_WhereGoldChest_Whistle_03_01": "What are you doing? Are you trying to lure monsters to us?",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_WhereGoldChest_Whistle_15_02": "I'm sorry, it's just nerves.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_WhereGoldChest_Go_15_01": "The chest is not far away.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_BertelResult_03_07": "All right, I'll get this to the Haven somehow. You try and find something else!",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_BertelResult_03_01": "Good thing you brought me here! Someone's already started going through the chest.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_BertelResult_15_02": "How do you know?",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_BertelResult_03_03": "There's coins scattered all over the place. I'll clean it up, but Cortez can't find out about it for the world.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_BertelResult_03_04": "Did you see the guy? He was getting into our gold!",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_BertelResult_15_05": "You killed him for nothing! Cortez wanted me to bring him people alive!",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_BertelResult_03_06": "And does Cortez need to know that? I thought you had already learned that.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_7_03_05": "I'll see you there!",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_7_03_03": "Okay, we'll get someone else to help.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_7_03_04": "Better safe than sorry, kid!",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_15_01": "Come on, Cortez gave us an assignment.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_03_02": "What is it this time?",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_15_03": "Someone's swindling the captain out of money for the provisions delivered to the Haven.",
  "DIA_Simon_HelpKillBantids_15_01": "I want you to come with me to the cave and get rid of them.",
  "DIA_Simon_HelpKillBantids_03_02": "And here I thought it was going to be a boring day.",
  "DIA_Simon_HelpKillBantids_03_03": "All right, kid, I'll meet you outside the cave. Just don't go near it without us!",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_15_04": "I want you to come with me to the cave and prepare an ambush for these bastards.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_03_05": "How many are there?",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_3_15_01": "About three.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_3_03_02": "So we'll have time to drink some more beer before we leave!",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_5_15_01": "About five.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_7_15_01": "About seven.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q304_7_03_02": "Oh, shit! I can see we're in for quite a fight.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCLetsGo_15_01": "Let's go.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCWhatAJoke_03_01": "And you were running from him?",
  "DIA_Simon_BCWhatAJoke_15_02": "There were more of them. They must have gotten rid of Antonio and escaped somewhere.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCWhatAJoke_03_03": "There's nothing in the cave but dead bodies, so we can go back. Gather what you can and get to Cortez immediately.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_15_01": "Everything ready?",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_03_02": "We're all ready.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_03_03": "For another beer.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_15_04": "Why are you sitting here drinking?",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_15_05": "You haven't done anything all this time? Cortez specifically told you to prepare an ambush.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_03_06": "Kid, don't get so hot, we'll just drink it up and get it over with.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_Start_15_01": "Do you have any ideas on where to start?",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_Start_03_02": "I was thinking of hiding behind the crates, and as soon as they appeared, jumping out and slicing up the bastards.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_Start_03_03": "They're some country bumpkins, no one in their right mind would try to rob Cortez.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_Start_03_04": "If you have a better plan, I'd love to hear it.",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_Bye_15_01": "I'll take a look around...",
  "DIA_Simon_BCReady_Bye_03_02": "Go ahead!",
  "DIA_Simon_Ambient_15_00": "How are you doing?",
  "DIA_Simon_Ambient_13_01": "Nothing new.",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHapped_15_01": "What happened here?",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHapped_03_02": "Don't even ask that out loud! Some of ours fell in agony after drinking wine from Oscar's blasted barrel.",
  "DIA_Simon_WhatHapped_03_03": "It's lucky he didn't open it for everyone right after the tournament, or none of us would be alive anymore.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Next_03_01": "You come into our camp, kill our captain and expect us to talk to you?",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Next_03_02": "We'll shoot you before you can move.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Future_15_01": "This is what awaits you if you don't give up!",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Capitulation_15_01": "I came here to make you all an offer of surrender.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Die_15_01": "Do you want to die for this place?",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Poison_15_01": "Look at you, what state are you in? There's only a handful of you left!",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Poison_03_02": "Each of us is worth more than ten guards. The King has already taken everything from us, we won't give him this as well!",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Trust_15_01": "You know me and you know I can be trusted!",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Trust_03_02": "Moritz mentioned that you helped him...",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Trust_03_03": "Most of the guys said you always fought fair...",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Trust_03_04": "Javad is particularly fond of you...",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Trust_03_05": "Even Fox has stated that you are okay...",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Trust_03_06": "And Rodrigo mentioned that no one finishes the job as well as you...",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Trust_03_07": "Okay, a few people trust you, but that doesn't mean we're suddenly going to give up because you told us so!",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Trust_03_08": "Don't be ridiculous! No one here cares about your fate!",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Leader_15_01": "I am the champion of this arena and I killed Cortez. I'm in charge now.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Leader_03_02": "You think you can intimidate us? You're on your own here, you may be the champion of the entire arena, but you're not immune to bolts.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Leader_03_03": "Before that, the champion was Ben. There was no match for him in a fight, but do you think anyone would go after him? Strength isn't everything!",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Orcs_15_01": "More orc troops are appearing on the island, you are not safe here.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Orcs_03_02": "We've already had one orc here, we can handle more if we need to!",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Finish_03_04": "Let's say you have our attention. What's in that surrender proposal?",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Finish_15_05": "You will escape with your lives, but at the cost of your freedom.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Finish_15_06": "You will be sent to the Mining Colony in Khorinis to mine magic ore for the King.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Finish_15_07": "In return, you will be provided with safety, food and a roof over your head.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Finish_03_08": "Looks like we don't have much choice...",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Finish_03_09": "We don't have much left to lose, and none of us are going to die for a piece of land.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Finish_03_10": "We give up.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Finish_03_02": "Extremely generous and tempting is this proposal...",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Finish_03_03": "Unfortunately, I cannot agree to it. We would rather die than be slaves to the King!",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Finish_03_01": "We've heard enough nonsense. Boys, get him!",
  "DIA_Simon_Q306_AfterTournament_03_01": "To you!",
  "DIA_Simon_SELLHEAD_Description": "I have everything you need. (Sell the head of a mantis)",
  "DIA_Simon_Stan_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_1_Choice": "He reportedly threatened Stan with death.",
  "DIA_Simon_Stan_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_2_Choice": "Why was Rodrigo so upset?",
  "DIA_Simon_Stan_SecretInfo_WhatHappened_3_Choice": "Why don't you want Rodrigo to know about the meeting?",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_Cortez_Yes_Choice": "I know.",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_WhereGoldChest_Whistle_Choice": "(Whistle)",
  "DIA_Simon_Q305_WhereGoldChest_Go_Choice": "The crate is not far away.",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Capitulation_Next_Die_Finish_Choice": "(Wait for a response)",
  "DIA_Simon_SQ503_Result_Capitulation_Next_Die_Orcs_Choice": "More troops of orcs appear on the island."
