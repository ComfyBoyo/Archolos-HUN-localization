  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_LetsTalk_15_01": "Let's talk... I'm sure we'll get along.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_LetsTalk_13_02": "Leave that pouch alone. I might as well pick up the gold from your corpse.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_LetsTalk_15_03": "Then what do you want?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_LetsTalk_13_04": "Who says I want anything?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_LetsTalk_13_05": "You've trespassed on not your own plot, and strangers are not welcome here.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_YouDontWantToDoThis_15_01": "In fact, you don't want to do it.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_YouDontWantToDoThis_13_02": "Why is that?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Ambient_15_00": "Did something happen?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Ambient_13_13": "Nothing new. You better don't wait to see Cortez, he likes to be among the first to know.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Ambient_13_14": "No, practically nothing. But that's okay, it's better to be bored than to have to deal with uninvited guests.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Ambient_13_15": "You're still asking? New arena champion, I still can't get used to it. Don't let it go to your head!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Ambient_13_16": "The last major event was a tournament, even if it ended the way it always does. Maybe someday something more unexpected will happen.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_03_01": "Welcome aboard.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Place_15_01": "What exactly is this place?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Place_03_02": "We call it the Scoundrels' Haven.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Place_03_03": "The worst scoundrels of the entire island gather here to booze, fight in the arena, cut a deal, and have a good time.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Rules_15_01": "Are there any rules here?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Rules_03_02": "The only rule you must remember in the Haven is to do everything Cortez wants you to do. He is the captain of this ship, and we are his sailors.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Rules_03_03": "Besides, everyone here is looking out for their own interests.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Rules_03_04": "If anyone sees you with a dagger between your ribs, they won't even lift a finger to help you. This isn't a town where reds don't take their eyes off you.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Rules_15_05": "You guys are pretty arbitrary here.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Rules_03_06": "It's a small price to pay for being able to do as we please.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Who_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Who_03_02": "My name is Thiago and I am a crew member of the famous Cortez.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Who_03_03": "I'm in charge of making sure not everybody enters our camp.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Who_03_05": "Fortunately, usually the swamps themselves are already enough of a scarecrow and there aren't too many curious people hanging around.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Cortez_15_01": "Tell me about Cortez.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Cortez_03_02": "Cortez is the leader of the Haven and captain of the 'Lorietta', the ship you see behind you.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Cortez_15_03": "That wrecked boat?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Cortez_03_04": "You can believe me that it used to look much better.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Cortez_03_05": "Many years ago, Cortez sailed across the seas and was a terror to the sailors, sacking ports and merchant frigates.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Cortez_03_06": "He's a fearless sea wolf with plenty of prey on his list.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Cortez_03_07": "I could tell you a long story about him, but it's best if you learn the details from him yourself.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Man_15_01": "Any three men come in here recently?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Man_03_02": "What did they look like?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Man_15_03": "Just like regular scumbags.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Man_03_04": "Maybe they went in, but I don't know where they went. Anyway, look around you. You got eyes, don't you?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Ben_15_01": "Has there been a big guy here lately?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Ben_03_02": "Big guy?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Ben_15_07": "He is also very strong and extremely mean.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Ben_03_08": "Many strong and mean types visit this place.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Ben_03_09": "Anyway, take a look for yourself. You got eyes, don't you?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Where_15_01": "Where do I go now?",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Where_03_02": "See that building next to us? Go upstairs.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Where_03_03": "This is the home of our captain, Cortez. If he's busy now, you'll have to wait a while.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Where_03_04": "You just happen to have arrived at a time when he's receiving 'guests'.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Where_03_05": "Remember to show him the proper respect and you will live like a king here.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Where_15_06": "Thanks for the tips.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Where_03_07": "I got my eye on you, newbie. Don't screw this up.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Iwillteachyou_13_01": "Look, I've been thinking. I'd love to make some money, and I have an idea how you could benefit from it.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Iwillteachyou_15_02": "Let's hear it.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Iwillteachyou_13_03": "Great! If you'd like, I can teach you how to shoot, both with a bow and crossbow, I'll practice by the way. Interested?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Iwillteachyou_15_04": "So you'll teach me, but for money?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Iwillteachyou_13_05": "Yes, but rest assured, I won't take much! I can also show you how to open locks and get trophies, which are very quick ways to make money!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Iwillteachyou_13_06": "About hunting, you'd have to know some basics, I don't want to explain them. But I'll tell you about extracting lard, mandibles, reptile skins and skinning bloodflies!",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_15_00": "I want to practice shooting.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_03_01": "Ekhem, I'd love to train with you, but you should probably teach me. I'm not going to show you anything new anyway.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_03_02": "Sure, get your weapon ready!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Train_CROSSBOW1_03_01": "I told you it would be cheap, but not that cheap!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Train_CROSSBOW5_03_01": "Add some to it, then we can start shooting.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Train_BOW1_03_01": "Ekhem, that's not too much. I take a little more for one lesson.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Train_BOW5_03_01": "If you offer a little more, I'm sure we'll get along!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_13_01": "Well, well, who do we have here...",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_13_02": "Not too far from the barracks, are you, boy? I hope Roderich doesn't yell at you.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_13_03": "Does Lorenzo allow you to leave the city since all your ships were taken away?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_13_04": "Tell me who sent you and what are you looking for here?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_End_13_01": "Follow me. I'll show you what's what.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_YouDontWantToDoThis_13_03": "I thought you were just trying to get to me.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_FromHere_15_01": "I'm one of Slasher's men. I stayed behind because I had to clean up this whole mess.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_FromHere_03_02": "I knew you guys were smart, but pretending to be a guard to take care of a crime scene? Now that's an idea...",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_FromHere_03_03": "The rest of them are probably smoking weed and eating meat by the fire by now. Get inside!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_FromHere_03_04": "I don't think you've been here before, have you?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_FromSalvi_15_01": "I'm one of Salvi's men. He sent me here to run some errands for him.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_FromSalvi_03_02": "I can spot the rags you're running around from a mile away.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_FromSalvi_03_03": "What?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Cortez_15_01": "I have a message directly to Cortez.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Cortez_03_02": "I don't like being lied to...",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Somebody_15_01": "I'm here to recruit some men. I heard about the three guys Cortez is using to do his dirty work.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Somebody_03_02": "I know who you mean. So we're in for some bloody action, huh?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Yannick_15_01": "I came with Yannick.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Yannick_03_02": "I don't see him here.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Yannick_15_03": "We had trouble at sea and now he's fixing a sail on shore not far from here. I can take you to him.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Yannick_03_04": "Even if this is true, many know Yannick and use his services. You might have just heard about him and you are just a little lost rat.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Joint_15_01": "I'm bringing something straight from the fishermen.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Joint_03_02": "A whole, fresh package? You must really have a deal with the fishermen.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Joint_03_03": "Anyone who carries that much swampweed is a good friend of mine.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Smuggler_15_01": "I'm one of the smugglers.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Smuggler_03_02": "Smugglers? Do you know how many people are smuggling goods on this island?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Beach_15_01": "We operate on the Amber Coast.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Beach_03_02": "I'll make sure your buddies find out who ratted them out once we come for their goods.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Buisness_15_01": "I wanted to offer Cortez a regular supply of food, alcohol and swampweed.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Buisness_03_02": "And I'm supposed to believe that?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Buisness_15_03": "I wonder how he'll react when he finds out that you made him lose such an offer.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Buisness_03_04": "All right, whatever. At least he'll kill you, not me.",
  "DIA_Thiago_SQ317_What_03_01": "Where are you guys going? Isn't that Dinkel's slave?",
  "DIA_Thiago_SQ317_What_Cortez_15_01": "Cortez wants us to repair palisade by his house.",
  "DIA_Thiago_SQ317_What_Cortez_03_02": "If Cortez himself wishes it... Just don't try any tricks.",
  "DIA_Thiago_SQ317_Where_03_01": "Where's the other one?",
  "DIA_Thiago_SQ317_Where_Swampsharks_03_03": "All right, none of my business. You'll have to explain yourself to Dinkel.",
  "DIA_Thiago_SQ317_Where_Swampsharks_15_01": "Things didn't go as planned, Homer was eaten by swampsharks.",
  "DIA_Thiago_SQ317_Where_Swampsharks_03_02": "There's no...",
  "DIA_Thiago_SQ317_Where_Forget_15_01": "Let's forget about the whole thing.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_Picklock_15_00": "Teach me how to open locks more efficiently.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_Picklock_03_01": "To open a better quality lock, you need not so much patience as feel. You need to handle it gently but firmly.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_Picklock_03_02": "Gently test to see if the lock pick fits into the mechanism. A firm resistance will be a sign for you to turn it the other way, remember.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_Picklock_03_03": "Sorry, I don't teach for free. Bring the gold, and we'll talk.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_Sneak_03_01": "Before I teach you this, I need to make sure you've mastered the basics - namely, stealth. When approaching someone's chest, bend your legs, walk slowly, discreetly. Otherwise, there's no point in grabbing the lock.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_Sneak_03_02": "Now for the specifics.",
  "DIA_Thiago_WELCOME_Where_03_08": "Correction, he RECEIVED visitors.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Q306_AfterTournament_03_01": "Who would have thought, I just almost shot you at the entrance to the Haven, and now you're the new arena champion!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Q306_AfterTournament_03_02": "I was afraid you wouldn't make it out of this tournament alive!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_03_01": "If you prepared the pouch, then yes.",
  "DIA_Thiago_AllHunt_03_01": "Well, I didn't expect you to be so gifted. There's nothing more I can teach you about hunting.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_BFSting_15_01": "How do you pull out the venom glands?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_BFSting_03_02": "If you want to tap into the poisonous glands of a bloodfly or drone, you'll need to examine their abdomen closely.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_BFSting_03_03": "You should be able to locate this soft spot without too much trouble. You press on it, and pull out the protruding stinger with a smooth motion.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_BFSting_03_04": "If you offer a little more, I'm sure we'll get along!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_Mandibles_15_01": "How do you get the mandibles?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_Mandibles_03_02": "How would you say it... you tug on them. Most species don't have them very delicate, so you can probably grab them and just pull them out.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_Mandibles_03_03": "If you offer a little more, I'm sure we'll get along!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_BFWing_15_01": "How do you rip out the wings of bloodflies?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_BFWing_03_02": "Not just bloodflies, drones too. In both cases, the pattern is similar. You grab the wing right at the abdomen, and pull it out, being careful not to break it.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_BFWing_03_03": "If you offer a little more, I'm sure we'll get along!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_Fats_15_01": "How to obtain animal fat?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_Fats_03_02": "The most important thing is to distinguish it from meat. In most cases the fat is white or yellowish in colour, so you catch what fits this description and cut it off.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_Fats_03_03": "Try to do it thoroughly, fat mixed with other... raw materials from the animal, it's not as valuable.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_Fats_03_04": "If you offer a little more, I'm sure we'll get along!",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_ReptileSkin_15_01": "How can I skin reptiles?",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_ReptileSkin_03_02": "Once you've kill a swampshark, or a snapper, or something like that, you need to find some weaknesses in it's skin.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_ReptileSkin_03_03": "The best way to do this is to make a cut in this area with something sharp, and then tug until you rip the whole thing off the carcass.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Hunting_Special_ReptileSkin_03_04": "If you offer a little more, I'm sure we'll get along!",
  "DIA_Thiago_IwillTeachAcrobat_13_01": "Listen, I see you've set yourself up pretty well here. Well, since you're so hard-working, why don't I show you how to get around faster in rough terrain like this swamp?",
  "DIA_Thiago_IwillTeachAcrobat_13_02": "Of course, if you put up some gold, such knowledge I cannot share for free.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_Acrobat_15_00": "Teach me acrobatics.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_Acrobat_03_01": "Look, sometimes instead of wading through this mix of water and plants, it's better to just pull forward as far as you can.",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_Acrobat_03_02": "If you fly over a slope and land lower than you expected, bend your legs as you land to cushion the momentum and not bruise oneself. It can save your life!",
  "DIA_Thiago_TRAIN_Acrobat_03_03": "If you offer a little more, I'm sure we'll get along.",
  "DIA_Thiago_MilitiaArmor_15_01": "No one will attack me because of my guard uniform?",
  "DIA_Thiago_MilitiaArmor_03_02": "Relax, there's been a few renegades through the Haven already. If you're in, that means you're okay.",
  "DIA_Thiago_MilitiaArmor_03_03": "Some of ours aren't fond of guards for obvious reasons, but they shouldn't cause you any problems. You can always beat the crap out of them if you need to.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_YouDontWantToDoThis_Choice": "You don't want to do that.",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_FromHere_Choice": "I'm one of Slasher's men...",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_FromSalvi_Choice": "I'm one of Salvi's men...",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_LetsTalk_Choice": "I'm sure we'll get along somehow... (Bribe)",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_FromSalvi_Somebody_Choice": "I came to recruit some people...",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Yannick_Joint_Choice": "I bring something straight from the fishermen. (Give swampweed)",
  "DIA_Thiago_Heyyou_Smuggler_Buisness_Choice": "I wanted to offer Cortez a regular delivery...",
  "DIA_Thiago_SQ317_Where_Forget_Choice": "Let's forget the whole thing. (50 GP)",
  "DIA_Thiago_SQ317_Where_Swampsharks_Choice": "Homer was eaten by swampsharks."
