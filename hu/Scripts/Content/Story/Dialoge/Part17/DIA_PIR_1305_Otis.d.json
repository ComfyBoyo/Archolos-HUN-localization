  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_13_01": "Yhm... Hello my friend!",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_Decline_13_00": "Suit yourself, you're missing out on a big bag of gold!",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_Accept_13_00": "I'll be here waiting after your next fight! Don't forget to pick up your winnings!",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_15_00": "What is it?",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_13_00": "And I get it! Look, it's simple. A few guys don't quite believe you'll beat the next opponents.",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_13_01": "In fact, they are so sure of it that they have decided to bet a few gold coins that you will not return here alive.",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_13_02": "I wanted to offer you the opportunity to bet on yourself. This deal is brilliant because you can't lose on it!",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_13_03": "If you win the next round, you get extra gold from the bet, if not... well... the gold won't be of any use to you then.",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_13_04": "What's it gonna be? Interested?",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_1_15_00": "No, I won't be a part of your shenanigans.",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_2_15_00": "I'd love to, make it 50 gold pieces.",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_2_13_00": "I would expect more confidence from someone who is going to win the final, but so be it. Good luck!",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_3_15_00": "I'm sure of my winnings, make it 100 gold.",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_3_13_00": "Confidence is the key! Good luck!",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_4_15_00": "I'm not afraid of another pirate or other stinking beasts, I'll bet 250 gold on myself.",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_5_13_00": "And that's the spirit of a winner! I told them Marvin was fearless and would gladly take the bet!",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_2_15_00": "Whatever it is, I'm not interested.",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_2_15_01": "Haven't you had enough?",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_2_13_01": "I understand your annoyance at this little... incident during our fight, but this time I have a perfectly fair proposition for you!",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_15_01": "What do you want?",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_13_01": "Man of action, you don't like to talk too much, do you?",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentFight_13_01": "See all those ovations?",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentFight_13_02": "Isn't this arena great?",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentFight_15_00": "Damn it, what have you done to me?",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentFight_13_03": "Me? What do you mean? Defend yourself!",
  "DIA_Otis_AfterTournamentFight_13_01": "Nothing like a fair duel!",
  "DIA_Otis_AfterTournamentFight_15_01": "You bloody leech...",
  "DIA_Otis_AfterTournamentFight_13_03": "You're better, I admit it!",
  "DIA_Otis_Whatareyoudoing_15_00": "What are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Otis_Whatareyoudoing_13_01": "I'm trading. What do you want to buy?",
  "DIA_Otis_Whatareyoudoing_15_02": "What do you trade?",
  "DIA_Otis_Whatareyoudoing_13_03": "Food, alcohol and other nonsense. So, you want to take a look? Cause, you know, you're blocking my sun.",
  "DIA_Otis_Anyjob_15_04": "Isn't it too humid in here?",
  "DIA_Otis_Anyjob_13_05": "Are you blind? The walls are starting to rot, we're gonna have to do something about this shithole.",
  "DIA_Otis_Anyjob_13_06": "But I prefer it to the three walls and bars in the city. What's wrong with this place?",
  "DIA_Otis_Anyjob_15_07": "I just...",
  "DIA_Otis_Anyjob_13_08": "I thought so. Anything else?",
  "DIA_Otis_Ambient_13_09": "None of your business.",
  "DIA_Otis_Ambient_13_10": "You come to get slapped again? Don't fool yourself, I'll trick you again.",
  "DIA_Otis_Ambient_13_11": "You already punched me once, what do you want?",
  "DIA_Otis_Trade_15_00": "Let me see what you got there.",
  "DIA_Otis_Trade_13_01": "Well, come on.",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelProposal_15_01": "I feel like having a little duel.",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelProposal_13_02": "A duel? Kid, you know what I need. Tournament's just around the corner. Can't wait. But, but, wait. Nothing free.",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelProposal_13_03": "A game with stakes is always more exciting. What do you think of that?",
  "DIA_Otis_Duel_15_01": "All right. I'm ready.",
  "DIA_Otis_Duel_13_02": "Well, I like that. Pull out your weapon!",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelAfter_13_01": "You still have a lot to learn if you want to stand a chance against an old hand like me. If you want to lose some more gold, go ahead.",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelAfter_13_02": "Damn, you're good. You're young and you can move. Well, here you are, you won fair and square.",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelTrain_15_01": "I want a rematch.",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelTrain_13_02": "Well, do you? You want to rebound? Do you have gold?",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelTrain_15_03": "I got it. Let's get started.",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelTrain_03_04": "Well, I like that. Pull out your weapon!",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelTrain_15_05": "I don't.",
  "DIA_Otis_DuelTrain_13_06": "Then why are you bothering me...",
  "DIA_Otis_TournamentBet_1_1_4_Choice": "I'm not afraid of a pirate or a beast, I'll bet 250 gold on myself."
