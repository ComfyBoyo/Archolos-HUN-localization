  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_03_01": "Not so fast, kid. There's a queue to talk to the boss. He's got another visitor, and from what I hear, the conversation gonna take a while.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Cave_15_01": "I saw you in the cave.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Cave_03_02": "This is getting interesting.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Cave_03_03": "What did you see in that cave, boy?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Gonzalo_15_01": "Why did you kill Gonzalo?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Gonzalo_03_02": "You say Gonzalo's dead?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Gonzalo_03_03": "It's a real tragedy. The death of someone so dedicated to his work is always sad.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Serious_15_01": "I ask seriously.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Serious_03_02": "One Gonzalo this way or that way, who cares if a meatbug dies?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Serious_03_03": "Since you're asking about him so much, he must have told you his sad story.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Serious_03_04": "His end should be a lesson to you that there is no return from some paths.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Serious_03_05": "Good advice, kid, keep your nose out of it and you'll be fine.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Business_15_01": "You guys said something about taking over the business.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Business_15_02": "Isn't this business about kidnapping people?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Business_03_03": "Kidnapping... is such an ugly term.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Business_03_04": "We simply transport people from one place to another...",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Business_03_05": "Sometimes against their will.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Silbach_15_01": "Do you know anything about the recent kidnapping in Silbach?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Silbach_03_02": "In this stinking village?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Silbach_03_03": "I even try not to pass by there, so as not to soak up the smell of dung.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Silbach_03_04": "Plus, we don't keep any list of who abducted whom and where, so I have no way to investigate.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Silbach_03_05": "Have you found out everything yet? Cause I'm losing the urge to be nice anymore.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Brother_15_01": "Someone had kidnapped my brother after trashing my uncle's hut.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Brother_15_02": "No idea who might have done this?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Brother_03_03": "If you care so much, you should know that me and the boys prefer the 'clean' approach.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Brother_15_04": "What does your meeting with Gonzalo prove?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Brother_03_05": "Getting rid of the remnants of this loser was not part of the contract, so I was more than happy to leave that task to the scavengers.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Professional_15_01": "You look like a professional.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Professional_15_02": "I don't think you'd botch the job so badly as to get noticed by a sentry and a few surrounding ones, would you?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Professional_03_03": "How sloppy does one have to be to allow something like this to happen?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Professional_15_04": "That's what the kidnapper committed, or more accurately, the kidnappers I'm tracking.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Professional_03_05": "And despite these leads, you still haven't found your man? I don't know which of you is worse.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Trace_15_01": "The clues I found indicate that there were two kidnappers.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Trace_15_02": "The former is a fat big man, the latter a slim, hooded man.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Trace_03_03": "Hmm...",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Trace_03_04": "This, as you called him, 'Fat Big Guy', and don't try to speak of him aloud in that way, may be Big Ben.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Trace_03_05": "Except that BIG is a significant understatement, the guy is as big as a golem.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Trace_03_06": "He lacks finesse and accuracy in doing his job, which agrees with your description, but when it comes to efficiency and brute force, he has no equal.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Trace_03_07": "He sits all day in the Lodge, on the floor of Oscar's Inn.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Trace_03_08": "If you actually have an interest in him, I wish you luck. You're going to need it.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Trace_03_09": "Now piss off. If anyone asks, we don't know each other, we've never seen each other, and so on.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Information_15_01": "I need information.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Information_03_02": "Do I look like a first-class innkeeper to you?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Information_03_03": "You want to know something, ask Oscar.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Who_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Who_03_02": "We? The elite guard of King Rhobar II.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Who_03_03": "Why are you so curious?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_What_15_01": "What are you doing here?",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_What_03_02": "We're waiting for someone, so if you have something important to talk about, you better make it quick.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Trace_03_10": "You know what? I think I'm gonna wait a few hours at Cortez's. You can take my place and go straight to him. Maybe you'll do better than that guy.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_Ambient_03_01": "Shit. How long are you gonna be hanging around here?",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_Ambient_03_02": "Who would have expected someone as inconspicuous as you to become our new champion. Not bad, really not bad.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_Ambient_03_03": "What a beautiful beating you got! Did you really expect to do anything in our arena? Ha!",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_15_01": "Harry says you helped the Royal Scout.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_15_02": "Something wrong?",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_03_03": "No... I mean, yes, something is wrong, and very wrong!",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_03_04": "The royal scout was keen on discretion, but since Harry had already spoken out, I think we can tell you a little something.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_NeedTalk_03_04": "It's such an old ruin, he was very keen to check something out there.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_Next_03_01": "Follow us, it's not far.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_NeedTalk_15_01": "I have a case for him.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_NeedTalk_03_02": "So you prefer to keep it to yourself, I see...",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_NeedTalk_03_03": "Let's do this my way, give me a solid gold pouch and we'll lead you to the place he was looking for.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_Grayson_15_01": "I am sent by the Royal Envoy.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_Grayson_03_02": "In that case, I guess we have no choice but to lead you to the place he was looking for.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_WaitASec_15_01": "Wait, I know you! You killed Gonzalo!",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_WaitASec_03_02": "Boys, get them!",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_NoGold_15_01": "I don't carry that much gold.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_NoGold_03_02": "All right, give me what you got and let's go because we're wasting our time.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_LetsFight_03_01": "Okay, trip's over.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Cave_Business_Silbach_Brother_Choice": "Someone trashed my uncle's hut to get my brother.",
  "DIA_BDT_Myrmidon_HELLO_Cave_Business_Silbach_Professional_Trace_Choice": "Circumstantial evidence suggests that there were two kidnappers.",
  "DIA_Myrmidon_KQ405_Harry_NeedTalk_200_Choice": "(Offer 200 GP)"
