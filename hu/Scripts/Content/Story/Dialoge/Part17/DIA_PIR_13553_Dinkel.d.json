  "DIA_Dinkel_Hello_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Dinkel_Hello_03_02": "I'm Dinkel. I used to be a bosun on a sizable pirate ship, and now all I have left is this ugly hut.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_Hello_03_03": "I've been sitting here for weeks and I think I'm going to die of boredom before I finally get the chance to go to sea again.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_15_01": "Why is Homer cleaning your house?",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_03_02": "Because he knows that if it's not clean around here, he'll get his head bashed in.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_Slave_15_01": "Is he your slave?",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_Slave_03_02": "You could call it that. It's something of a souvenir from my days when I was still sailing the seas. I captured him on some merchant ship.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_Slave_03_03": "He even fixed the roof on my hut recently, I think he used to be a carpenter or something.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_Slave_03_04": "It's nice to have someone who take care of your hut when you're out hunting and coming straight back from the swamp in muddy boots.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_Free_15_01": "You have to let him go.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_Free_03_02": "Are you crazy? He's my slave! If you don't want to help him clean up right away, you better get out of here!",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_Pay_15_01": "I will pay for his freedom.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_Pay_03_02": "I won't let him go for less than 2000 gold pieces!",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_Leave_15_01": "Let's forget about this case.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_Pay_Description": "Here's your gold. (buy out Homer for 2000 GP)",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_Pay_15_01": "Here's your gold.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_Pay_03_02": "You gotta be kidding me...",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_Pay_03_03": "I don't know why you care so much about him, but gold is gold!",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_Pay_03_04": "Take him, I'm off to the inn for a beer!",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_15_01": "I need to borrow Homer for a while.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_03_02": "Why is that?",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Cortez_15_01": "Cortez ordered him to repair palisade by his hut.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Cortez_03_02": "Yeah, I hear he gets those stinky drones flying in there from time to time.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Cortez_03_03": "How can I be sure he really sent you here? Do you even have any tools to work with?",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Next_03_01": "All right, get him!",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Next_03_02": "Although now that I think about it... I'm gonna go over there with you guys. For my own peace of mind.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Ask_15_01": "You can go and ask Cortez yourself, he'll probably be happy...",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Tools_15_01": "I have the tools for Homer here, but if you want, you can ask Cortez yourself...",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Alone_15_01": "We can handle ourselves.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Alone_03_02": "Ourselves? I knew you were up to something! I'll teach you, laddie!",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_LetsGo_03_02": "Relax, I was just checking up on you...",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_LetsGo_03_03": "Homer! They got a job for you at the palisade. Don't let anything eat you up, you've still got a hut to clean!",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_WhereHomer_03_01": "Where is my slave?",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_WhereHomer_Swampshark_15_01": "Things did not go as planned, Homer was eaten by swampsharks.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_WhereHomer_Swampshark_03_02": "You've got to be kidding me! You expect me to believe that?",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_WhereHomer_Hand_15_01": "It's all that's left of him.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_WhereHomer_Hand_03_02": "Oh, shit. I don't even have anyone to complain, Cortez himself ordered these repairs...",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_WhereHomer_Hand_03_03": "...and I'll still have to find someone new to clean the hut!",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_WhereHomer_Cortez_15_01": "Cortez said he would personally compensate you.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_WhereHomer_Cortez_03_02": "He really said that? Damn, pity the slave, but Cortez can be really generous.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_WhereHomer_Cortez_03_03": "Maybe I won't come out so bad after all.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_Tavern_03_01": "What are you looking at? Can't you see I'm busy?",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_AboutHomer_Slave_Pay_Choice": "I will pay for his life.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Cortez_Tools_Choice": "I have the tools for Homer here.",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_NeedHomer_Cortez_Tools_Next_LetsGo_Choice": "Let's go! (Bluff)",
  "DIA_Dinkel_SQ317_WhereHomer_Swampshark_Hand_Choice": "(Show bloody hand)"
