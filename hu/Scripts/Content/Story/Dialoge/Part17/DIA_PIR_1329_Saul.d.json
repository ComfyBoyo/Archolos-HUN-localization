  "DIA_Saul_TournamentFight_Start_13_01": "How are you feeling?",
  "DIA_Saul_TournamentFight_Start_13_02": "Don't you feel a little dizzy?",
  "DIA_Saul_TournamentFight_Start_13_03": "It's too bad you weren't tempted by my treat.",
  "DIA_Saul_TournamentFight_Start_13_04": "I'll have to get rid of you the classic way.",
  "DIA_Saul_TournamentFight_Cheater_15_01": "You dirty crook!",
  "DIA_Saul_TournamentFight_Cheater_13_01": "No name-calling, please.",
  "DIA_Saul_TournamentFight_Cheater_13_02": "You will have the opportunity to prove yourself in a duel.",
  "DIA_Saul_TournamentFight_BetOnly_15_01": "Are you just betting on fights?",
  "DIA_Saul_TournamentFight_BetOnly_13_01": "Did I ever say I ONLY bet on them?",
  "DIA_Saul_AfterTournamentFight_13_03": "You were lucky bastard!",
  "DIA_Saul_AfterTournamentFight_13_04": "One more punch from me, and you'd be the one chewing sand.",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_03_01": "Hey you! How are you feeling after your last fight? Did you get hit hard?",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_IGotSomething_03_01": "I have something here that should get you back on your feet.",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_Bad_15_01": "The guy was definitely cheating, I got thrashed.",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_NotBad_15_01": "It wasn't that bad...",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_WhatsThat_15_01": "What is it?",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_WhatsThat_03_01": "A healing potion combined with a strength potion.",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_WhatsThat_03_02": "I bought it some time ago from Hierro.",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_Why_15_01": "Why do you want to help me?",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_Why_03_01": "Look, let's call it an investment. I put a lot of money on you.",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_Why_03_02": "You'll get a bottle for free now, If you win, I'll get a nice sum.",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_Why_03_03": "So, what do you say?",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_NoThanks_15_01": "I'm not interested.",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_NoThanks_03_01": "Suit yourself!",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_GiveMe_15_01": "Okay, give me that.",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_GiveMe_03_01": "Well, better?",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_GiveMe_15_02": "Definitely, thanks.",
  "DIA_Saul_Q306_Potion_GiveMe_03_02": "Yeah, no problem, kid.",
  "DIA_Saul_AfterTournamentFight_13_05": "You should thank me, I did you a huge favor. With your skills, the next opponents would tear you to shreds.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_03_01": "We meet again! I know we didn't start our friendship under pleasant circumstances, but this is a great opportunity to get to know each other better.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_03_02": "You're new here, aren't you? You must be quite smart if you're still alive.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_03_03": "You haven't talked to Berter yet, have you?",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_15_04": "I didn't get a chance to meet him.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_03_05": "Great, even perfect. That old bastard got under my skin. I want you to help me get revenge on him.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_15_06": "You want me to kill him?",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_03_07": "What?! No, of course not! You could say that me and Berter have this game of our own where we try to do something fun, inventive and preferably painful to each other.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_03_08": "Berter isn't in the Haven at the moment, but he'll probably be back soon, so we have to think of something to give him a hard time. Guy loves to eat pea soup after hunting and then he doesn't let me live.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_03_09": "I've been wanting to add something to his pot, but I have no idea what might be appropriate.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_No_15_01": "I won't play your games.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_No_03_02": "Well, yeah, a serious dude doesn't feel like to have some fun.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_Yes_03_02": "Just hurry, Berter might be back at any minute.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Start_Yes_15_01": "I'll try to think of something.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_TakeQuest_15_01": "I changed my mind, I'll help you figure something out.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_15_01": "I have an idea about the pea soup.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_03_02": "Yeah? Tell me!",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Nothing_15_01": "I'll still think about it.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Nothing_03_02": "Just hurry, Berter might be back at any minute.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_End_03_01": "All right, come with me, you spice the soup and I'll stand watch.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_End_15_02": "Why do I have to spice it up?",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_End_03_03": "Do you know what Berter looks like? That's right. How are you supposed to look for a guy you've never seen before?",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_End_03_04": "Get in the hut and take care of that pot. Make it quick!",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Dragon_15_01": "Maybe you should give him some dragon dust. It's an extremely pungent spice from faraway lands. As far as I know, it burns hotter than a fireball.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Dragon_03_02": "I've never heard of all this dust. Where am I gonna get something like that here?",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Dragon_15_03": "This spice is one that Rodrigo uses regularly, but I just so happen to have a few more grains with me.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Dragon_03_04": "Not bad at all... I knew you were worth talking to, you've got a head!",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Pepper_15_01": "Try these black peppercorns.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Pepper_03_02": "Sounds good, I can't wait to see his contorted face after this meal.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Head_15_01": "I happen to have that severed head with me, maybe...",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Head_03_02": "Are you crazy?! Shit, what's that head for? What kind of man runs around an island with a severed head on his belt?",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Head_03_03": "Let me know if you come up with something normal.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Shit_15_01": "Maybe you can spice up his dish with something stinky.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Shit_03_02": "It's disgusting...",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Shit_03_03": "Whatever, give it to me! This is a meal Berter won't forget.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Pearl_15_01": "What do you think about adding something hard to the meal?",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Pearl_03_02": "Haha, Berter will have to set aside some coins for new gold teeth after this.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Finish_03_01": "So, is it ready?",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Finish_15_02": "Yes, Berter will have quite a feast.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Finish_03_03": "All right, I'll take care of the rest. Grab these few bottles of rum as a reward. Thanks for your help!",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Dragon_Choice": "Maybe you should add some dragon dust?",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Pepper_Choice": "Try these black peppercorns.",
  "DIA_Saul_SQ310_Idea_Head_Choice": "I happen to have this skull with me, maybe..."
