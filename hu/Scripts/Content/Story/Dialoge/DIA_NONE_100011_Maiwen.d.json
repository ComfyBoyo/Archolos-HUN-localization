  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_15_00": "Do you like the conditions here?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_11_01": "Not so much. I've never eaten too much, but what they serve us here is a misunderstanding!",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_11_02": "And then there's the stench. They should keep all the waste somewhere further away from the huts, like we did.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_15_03": "Then I see I don't have to ask you anything...",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_11_04": "A... Oh. Okay, so... if you can get us anything, I'd appreciate it, remember.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_11_01": "I told him... I asked him to take us to Khorinis, not that damn Archolos, but he wouldn't listen.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_11_02": "I knew something bad was going to happen and I wasn't wrong!",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_11_03": "Why didn't he listen to me!?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_15_04": "Did he...",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_11_05": "HE'S DEAD!",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_15_06": "I'm sorry.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_11_07": "We were supposed to start a new life, away from the turmoil of war. To start a home, a family... why didn't you listen to me, my love...",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_15_08": "You should come with us. The others are already in the village. You'll be safe there.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_11_09": "I don't think about being safe right now.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_11_10": "I'm staying here with Darryl.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_15_11": "Listen to me! Nothing will bring him back to life, but if you stay here, you'll quickly join him.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_11_12": "I don't care.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_15_13": "Don't talk nonsense. You're cold and there's a lot of wild beasts around.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_11_14": "I can't just leave him here! I have to take care of him...",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_15_15": "All right, we'll bury him.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_15_16": "But then you have to come with us, understand?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundHelp_11_17": "Yes...",
  "DIA_Maiwen_VillageTeleport_Description": "Come, I'll walk you to the village. (fast travel)",
  "DIA_Maiwen_VillageTeleport_15_01": "Come on, I'll walk you to the village, you'll be safe there.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_15_01": "How are you holding up?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_11_02": "And how is a woman who has just lost her husband supposed to hold on?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_11_03": "I don't know if I'll ever be able to return to a normal life again.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_15_06": "If you need an activity, maybe I could find you something.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_11_07": "Sure, why not? Anything to stop thinking about the last few days.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_15_08": "Albyn, the village Elder, needs men for manual labor. Do you think you could handle it?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_11_09": "Where I come from, manual labor is the only job I know.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Q104_11_10": "I'll go to him right away.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_15_01": "Could I ask you a few questions?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_11_02": "What is it?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_15_03": "Have you seen anyone suspicious lately?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_11_04": "Most of the people in this village seem suspicious to me, but... Yes... There was someone.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_11_05": "I went outside to get some fresh air when I saw some big, broad-shouldered guy.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_11_06": "I give you my word that even in my hometown it's hard to find someone of similar height.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_WhereDidHeGo_15_01": "Where did the broad-shouldered guy go?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_WhereDidHeGo_11_02": "He wandered around the back of the inn and near the river for a while. He looked like he was waiting for someone, but through the storm I quickly lost sight of him.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_WhereDidHeGo_11_03": "Then I went back inside to warm up.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_WhereDidHeGo_11_04": "That's all I know.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_WhereDidHeGo_15_05": "Thanks for your help.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_WhereDidHeGo_11_06": "Is something wrong?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_WhereDidHeGo_15_07": "My brother is missing. I assume he was kidnapped.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_WhereDidHeGo_11_08": "Jorn? Who would want to kidnap such a golden man?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_WhereDidHeGo_15_09": "That's what I'm trying to figure out.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_WhereDidHeGo_11_10": "I hope he finds himself whole and healthy.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_When_15_01": "When did you see him?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_When_11_02": "In the evening, it was pouring.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_When_11_03": "Moments after that, an elderly man ran into the inn, he was all wet. It was hard to distinguish whether it was sweat or rain.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_When_11_04": "He ran to the back room for something and after a moment he ran back outside with the young boy, Viktor.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Okay_15_01": "Are you all right?",
  "DIA_Maiwen_Okay_11_02": "Yeah, Darryl didn't feel well. We'll be right with you. We just need a minute.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_SQ103_Thanks_11_01": "Thanks, I want to go back to the village.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundRune_03_01": "One more thing. When we were sitting in that cave, I found this stone.",
  "DIA_Maiwen_FoundRune_03_02": "I find it rather... strange. Like it's pulsing with energy. I think you'll get more use out of it than I will."
