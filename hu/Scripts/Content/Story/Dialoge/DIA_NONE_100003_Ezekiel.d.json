  "DIA_Ezekiel_Forwholelife_03_01": "I watched over them like an eye in my head, afraid that I would lose them and my business would fail.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Forwholelife_03_02": "I was so caught up in them that everything else ceased to have any meaning for me.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Forwholelife_03_03": "I made sure the coins were safe, but I couldn't protect my own daughter.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Forwholelife_fault_15_00": "Don't beat yourself up. It's not your fault.",

  "DIA_Ezekiel_Forwholelife_fault_03_02": "I should have stayed with Flora on Laran instead of talking her into this damn trip.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Forwholelife_fault_03_03": "I had a job there, and she had her whole life ahead of her.",

  "DIA_Ezekiel_Forwholelife_lesson_15_00": "Each of us gets lessons from life.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Forwholelife_lesson_15_01": "May you just learn from yours.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Forwholelife_lesson_03_02": "And what could someone like you know about life?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Forwholelife_lesson_03_03": "You barely jumped out of your mother's womb and you're trying to teach me humility, boy? ME?!",

  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_What_Flora_15_03": "Tell me, why should an entire family die? Her death is already a tragedy, and you want to add another.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_What_Flora_03_04": "You may be right... but someday we're gonna come back here and kill everything that touched her body, okay?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_What_Flora_15_05": "All right. Come on.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_What_Force_15_01": "You're coming with us or I'll drag you in by force.",

  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Start_15_01": "Why don't I go get your daughter?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Start_03_02": "No, this is something the father must do himself.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Start_03_03": "However, I don't want to bury my beloved daughter somewhere in a ditch under the woods.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Start_03_04": "She deserves a proper burial.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Start_03_05": "Could you help the old man and talk to a local mage? Maybe there's room in the local graveyard.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Start_03_06": "I'll recuperate for a while.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Start_15_07": "I'll think about it...",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Start_03_08": "Okay, just remember. We don't have much time.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Pay_15_01": "You have to pay for a spot at the cemetery.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Pay_03_02": "Damn, unfortunately I have no money.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Pay_03_03": "No one will lend me any gold here.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Pay_03_04": "All I have left is this ore. It's worth a lot. Don't ask how I smuggled it in.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_Pay_03_05": "Take it, you might be able to sell it profitably.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GraveReady_15_01": "I arranged for Flora to be interred in a local cemetery.",

  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GraveReady_Next_03_01": "I can't take you. No offense, but you don't look strong.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GraveReady_Next_03_02": "But you can help me convince the sentries here to help me.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GraveReady_Next_03_03": "I think it will be awkward for them to say no in that situation.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GraveReady_Go_15_01": "I'd be happy to go with you.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GraveReady_What_15_01": "What do you mean?",

  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GraveReady_No_15_01": "Maybe some other time.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GraveReady_No_03_02": "I'm sorry to hear that. I can't do it alone.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GuardsReady_15_01": "I managed to convince two sentries to help you.",

  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GuardsReady_03_03": "Thank you so much for your help. Maybe someday I can repay you.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_GuardsReady_03_04": "Now, if you'll excuse me. I have to call the sentries and find Flora.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ118_ThankYou_03_01": "Thanks again for your help.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_WhatNext_15_01": "What are you going to do now?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_WhatNext_03_02": "That's a good question. A parent's job is to take care of their children.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_WhatNext_03_03": "I failed to take care of her life, so now I will at least see to it that her grave is not unattended.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_WhatNext_03_04": "I have to get myself some work to pay for all the expenses.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_WhatNext_03_05": "I would love to get back into trading, but I don't know where to start.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Start_15_01": "Maybe, I could help you get back to your old trade?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Start_03_02": "If you hear of any opportunities, please let me know.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Veit_15_01": "Would you like to replace merchant Veit in the village?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Veit_03_02": "I'd like that. I could stay near my daughter's grave and keep an eye on it.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_VeitNeedGold_15_01": "Veit could sell you contacts to his suppliers.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_VeitNeedGold_03_02": "I'll have to do without it.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_GotListVeit_15_01": "I paid off Veit, he'll send his men to you.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_GotListVeit_03_02": "Amazing, I don't know how I'm going to repay you for all this.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_GotListVeit_03_03": "You're a really good boy.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Work_15_01": "Albyn wants you to do some work at the inn first.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Work_03_02": "Okay, I'll get to work.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Work_03_03": "Come see me in a while. Maybe I could use some help.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_HowsWork_15_01": "How was work?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_HowsWork_03_02": "Damn, I didn't think our presence took such a toll on the accounts here.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_HowsWork_03_03": "The inn is quite short on supplies.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_HowsWork_03_04": "Martha is too proud to ask for help, and Bastian fears Albyn's wrath, so they sit quietly.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_HowsWork_15_05": "Let's get to the point, what do you need? Just don't say you're short of gold...",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_HowsWork_03_06": "We need beer. I think they put it out on the counter here for free.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_HowsWork_03_07": "Plus some parsley would be nice.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_HowsWork_03_08": "Apparently, it's the secret ingredient in Martha's stew, and it's also been known to disappear.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_HowsWork_15_09": "How much do you need?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_HowsWork_03_10": "10 beers and 10 parsley.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_GotBeer_15_01": "I have beers.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_GotParsley_15_01": "I have parsley.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_GotParsley_03_02": "It's perfect. Martha will be so happy.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_GotDoc_15_01": "Please, here's a permit to trade in the village.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_GotDoc_03_02": "Oh, shit! Did you manage to get it? That's great.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_GotDoc_03_03": "I'll get to work, then. Thank you.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Sword_15_01": "How is working with Veit's people going?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Sword_03_02": "It's working out great. You know they belong to the Merchant Guild?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Sword_03_03": "They have some really good suppliers. I recently noticed a very beautiful sword from them and immediately thought of you.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_Sword_03_04": "As compensation, I'll sell it to you on the cheap.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_SQ227_BuySword_Description": "(Buy a cheap master sword for 900 GP)",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_AMBIENT_03_02": "Slowly for now, but I see considerable potential here.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_TRADE_15_01": "Show me your wares.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Q505_Help_03_01": "It may not be the easiest of jobs, but with the right attitude on Archolos you can make quite a bit of money as a trader.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Q505_Help_03_02": "I'm even considering joining the Merchant Guild...",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Q505_Help_03_03": "But now you're an important person, you probably don't even have time to listen to this. Please accept this small gift as a thank you for your help.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Q505_Help_03_04": "Since I haven't been able to sell this sword in all this time, I'm unlikely to succeed. I won't regret it if you wield it.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Q505_Help_03_05": "If you had let me stay on that beach that day... There would have been no one to remember my daughter or pray at her grave. Again, thank you.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Ambient_First_15_00": "Are you okay?",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Ambient_First_13_01": "My daughter... my poor daughter...",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Ambient_First_13_02": "Since you've settled things with my daughter, things are getting better.",
  "DIA_Ezekiel_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_Description": "The Elder needs hands for work."
