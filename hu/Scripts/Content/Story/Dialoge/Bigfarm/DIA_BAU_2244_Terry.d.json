  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_AttackEnd_03_00": "Thank you.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_AttackEnd_15_01": "You're welcome, really. Actually, I should apologize to you.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_AttackEnd_03_07": "I'd better go before he decides to come back. Maybe we'll see each other again. Under better circumstances, I hope.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_03_01": "Through the mists I can see an island like from my childhood dreams, how I wish I could see it again...",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_NiceSong_15_01": "Nice song.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_NiceSong_03_02": "I used to have a less hoarse voice when I was younger, too, but I'm glad you liked it.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_WhoAreYou_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_WhoAreYou_03_02": "My name is Terry. I'm an itinerant singer and this is how I make my living.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_WhoAreYou_15_03": "I don't think you have a large audience here.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_WhoAreYou_03_04": "It used to be better, but today most of my listeners are animals and raindrops.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_HowMany_03_02": "I'd love to chat with you, boy. It's not often I get a chance to have a word with someone, but... all that singing made me hungry as a wolf.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_HowMany_03_03": "Do you have anything to eat? All the rats and meatbugs in the area have burrowed through these downpours, and I can't kill anything else.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_HowMany_15_01": "Do a lot of people walk down that road?",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Food_15_01": "Please.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Food_03_02": "May Adanos bless you.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_SawAnybody_15_01": "So, have you seen anyone here lately?",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_SawAnybody_03_02": "I'll tell you the truth, I'm seeing less and less people around here. The tracts are full of wolves and bandits, so people are afraid to leave their homes.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_SawAnybody_03_03": "But sometimes a few drunks from the inn will show up, like those last night.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_SawAnybody_03_04": "One of them was so drenched that he could barely drag his feet. He was lucky that there were two friends with him, because he wouldn't have gone far.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Where_15_03": "Thanks for the help, but I have to go now.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Where_03_04": "Have a good trip, boy. Thank you again for the food.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Where_03_05": "Maybe we'll meet again, and I'll sing you something once more.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Where_15_01": "Remember which way they went?",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Where_03_02": "North towards the city, like most people travelling from the countryside.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_RlyDrunk_15_01": "How do you know the guy they were carrying was drunk and not injured?",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_RlyDrunk_03_02": "It's hard to tell, but he looked to me like someone who must have had a lot of fun.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_RlyDrunk_03_03": "It was night, and I was warming myself by the fire, so I couldn't see much.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_RlyDrunk_03_04": "I also didn't look too closely so as not to tempt fate. What if it were some hoodlums?",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Look_15_01": "Remember what they looked like?",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Look_03_02": "One of them was as big and thick as an old oak tree, and the other looked like he hadn't eaten in weeks.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Look_03_03": "I also remember that the one they were dragging behind them was bald.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_Look_03_04": "That's all I know.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_SingJob_15_01": "Can you make a living singing?",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_SingJob_03_02": "It can be done if you have high-profile friends and a roof over your head. Today, however, no one appreciates itinerant singers anymore.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_SingJob_03_03": "But I live, somehow. Here I kill a molehog, there I steal the eggs of a scavenger. And if I'm lucky, travelers will throw me a coin.",
  "DIA_Terry_GQ001_JornV1_Description": "Apparently, three people passed through here some time ago.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_DickonToldMe_15_01": "Apparently, three men passed through here some time ago. One fat as a barrel, the other skinny as a pole. The last one staggered like a drunk and was bald.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_DickonToldMe_15_02": "You haven't seen them by any chance?",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_TellMe_15_01": "So what, have you seen anyone here with that description or not?",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_TellMe_03_02": "Wait a minute... fat as a barrel... skinny as a pole...",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_TellMe_03_03": "Actually, the description sounds familiar. They passed me recently.",
  "DIA_Terry_WhereIsJorn_TellMe_03_05": "They didn't even look at me, just dragged the bald wretch along the road.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_03_01": "It was you! You poisoned Holdwig!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Fight_15_01": "You should be taught a lesson!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Fight_03_02": "What's the matter? I don't understand!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Fight_03_03": "You'll get yours, you bastard!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Wait_15_01": "Wait a minute, let's talk to him first.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Wait_03_02": "What?! You want to talk to the killer?",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Wait_15_03": "As far as we know, he didn't kill anyone...",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Wait_03_04": "But Holdwig!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Wait_15_05": "Holdwig is alive, and by acting rashly, we will not know what happened to him.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Wait_03_06": "Get out of my way!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Wait_15_07": "No.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Wait_03_08": "You asked for it!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_03_01": "Who ordered you to kill Holdwig?",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_03_02": "Hol... what?",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_03_03": "No way, I'll kill the bastard!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_15_04": "Wait!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_15_05": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_03_06": "Who are you?!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_15_07": "Look, I can't vouch for him, so if you don't want to be dead, you better answer the questions.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_03_08": "I'm T-T-T-Terry... I just... I didn't steal anything, I swear!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_15_09": "What's that?",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_03_10": "You guys are from that vineyard, right? I was in the kitchen there, asking for some leftover food. I was very hungry.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_03_11": "Who ordered you to kill Holdwig?",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_03_12": "I don't know what you mean!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_03_13": "I know of no murder, no Holdwig!",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_15_14": "He probably doesn't really know anything.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_WhoDidIt_03_15": "He's lying!",
  "DIA_Terry_Ambient_03_01": "I'm fine. I enjoy the beauty of nature, I sing my favorite songs, I have no reasons to complain.",
  "DIA_Terry_Ambient_03_02": "I'm fine. I hope your search is moving forward.",
  "DIA_Terry_Ambient_03_03": "Ever since you had to rescue me from that psycho, I don't feel so safe on the island anymore. But I'm holding on.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_AboutHoldwig_Talk_15_01": "Don't play dumb, tell me what you know.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_AboutHoldwig_Belive_15_01": "Okay, relax, I believe you.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_AboutHoldwig_Belive_15_02": "You'd better get out of here and not show up on the vineyard again, because I don't know if Dennis will find you innocent either.",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_Cutscene_Fight_Choice": "You should be taught a lesson! (Attack)",
  "DIA_Terry_GQ001_SawSomeone_Drunk_Choice": "How do you know the guy they were carrying was drunk?",
  "DIA_Terry_SQ116_AboutHoldwig_Talk_Scare_Choice": "(Intimidate)"
