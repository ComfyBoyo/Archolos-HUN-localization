  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_LookingForHoldwig_02_01": "Well, you found him, but in bad health. He's in the chamber. No one's allowed in there.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_LookingForHoldwig_15_01": "My uncle, Kurt, sent me to get the money for a job he did.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_LookingForHoldwig_02_02": "So I hear, give him my congratulations on a job well done.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_LookingForHoldwig_15_02": "Thank you, but we would prefer a more tangible token of appreciation.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_LookingForHoldwig_02_03": "As for the gold, I'm very sorry, but Holdwig decides that. Only he has the keys to the vault. Until he wakes up, there's nothing I can do.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_IfWontWakeUp_15_00": "What if Holdwig doesn't wake up?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_IfWontWakeUp_02_01": "Don't say that!",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_IfWontWakeUp_15_01": "Relax, I am only considering such circumstances. I am sorry your master is indisposed, but my uncle is waiting for his gold.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_IfWontWakeUp_02_02": "I already told you. Until Holdwig regains consciousness and gives me access to the vault, you will not get your gold.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_CanHelp_15_00": "Is there anything I can do to help?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_CanHelp_02_01": "Are you a healer?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_CanHelp_15_02": "No.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_CanHelp_02_03": "I thought so.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_CanHelp_02_04": "We'd already sent a boy to get a medic in town, because that damn Bodowin didn't deign to move his ass from his workshop. Nothing left to do but wait.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_CanHelp_02_06": "Maybe you could look around the farm, ask people.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_CanHelp_15_07": "Ask about what?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_CanHelp_02_08": "I suspect Holdwig may have been poisoned, but I have no proof.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_CanHelp_02_09": "You are an outsider, people may be less careful around you. If you find out anything, let me know.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TalkWithHoldwig_15_00": "Can I talk to Holdwig?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TalkWithHoldwig_02_01": "Yeah, he's at his place. He's still tired, so make it quick.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TalkWithHoldwig_02_02": "Not until this is all cleared up and his life isn't in danger. No one will get to see him but me.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_WhoPoisoned_15_00": "Who could have tried to poison Holdwig?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_WhoPoisoned_02_01": "If I knew that, I wouldn't be sitting on my hands here.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_WhoPoisoned_02_02": "I don't know who did the poisoning, but I suspect who the employer might be.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_WhoPoisoned_15_01": "Will you share this knowledge with me?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_WhoPoisoned_02_03": "No.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_InvestigationStatus_02_02": "It's definitely him! That bastard must have put something in Holdwig's food. When I get him...",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_InvestigationStatus_02_03": "Where is he?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerrysIsDown_Kill_02_00": "One less piece of garbage!",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerrysIsDown_Kill_02_01": "Let's see what he's got here...",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerrysIsDown_Kill_02_02": "I thought I'd find some evidence on him, and he doesn't even have gold? If he accepted the contract to kill, he should have got paid.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerrysIsDown_Kill_15_03": "Maybe he was supposed to get the gold after Holdwig's death?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerrysIsDown_Kill_02_04": "Are you sure this is the man Gumbert was talking about?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerrysIsDown_Kill_15_05": "Uh...",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerrysIsDown_Kill_15_06": "...I think it's him.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerrysIsDown_Kill_02_07": "Great, we don't even know if we killed the right person.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerryMeeting_Wait_15_00": "Wait!",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerryMeeting_Wait_02_01": "Are you standing up for a criminal?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerryMeeting_Wait_15_02": "Maybe we can get something out of him?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerryMeeting_Wait_02_03": "You're right.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerrysIsDown_02_00": "Die! Scum!",
  "DIA_Dennis_TerryMeeting_LetsTalk_AfterFight_02_00": "Fool, because of you, the vagrant run away!",
  "DIA_Dennis_TerryMeeting_LetsTalk_AfterFight_15_01": "Good.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_WhoCouldTryPoison_15_05": "You said you knew who might have ordered the poisoning. Who did you have in mind?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_WhoCouldTryPoison_02_06": "The only person who has a motive, and would be capable of such a thing, is Holdwig's brother, Andreas.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_CanHelp_02_05": "But I'm worried about the master. He doesn't look well. I wish there was something I could do to help him, but I don't know how.",
  "DIA_Dennis_FIRSTWARN_03_01": "Whoa, whoa, you won't pass any further.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SECONDWARN_03_01": "I warn you, one more step and you'll regret it.",
  "DIA_Dennis_FINALWARN_03_01": "I warned you.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_InvestigationStatus_Description": "Apparently there was a stranger hanging around the vineyard...",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_InvestigationStatus_15_01": "Apparently there was a stranger hanging around the vineyard. Gumbert saw him one day by the provisions cart, and the man immediately fled.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_TerrysIsDown_Kill_02_08": "Wait a minute, I'll go get Gumbert.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_03_01": "What are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_03_02": "Holdwig almost died, and you're stealing our wine?!",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_03_03": "I'll teach you some manners!",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_15_01": "Easy! Wait!",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_15_02": "Gumbert and I looked for what might have harmed Holdwig and...",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_03_03": "And you thought, you genius, that it had to be wine...",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_03_04": "And I'm supposed to believe you? First of all, Gumbert always finds a good excuse to drink, and secondly...",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_15_05": "Don't talk, just try it...",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_03_06": "To make me sick too? Are you crazy?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_15_07": "Try it!",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_03_08": "Yuck! It's gone sour.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_03_09": "If Holdwig actually drank that, it's no wonder he got sick.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_15_10": "I told you it hurt me, and you accuse me of being drunk...",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_03_11": "All right, all right. We need to get rid of that hellish concoction anyway.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_03_12": "In the meantime, while you were sleeping so soundly here, a medic came by.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_03_13": "Holdwig's doing better. The medic said that he just got sick after eating some nasty stuff. There was no poisoning.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_15_14": "Can I talk to him?",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_Vine_Wait_03_15": "Yes, he's in his office.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_InvestigationStatus_15_04": "Apparently, he headed toward the road by the waterfall.",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_InvestigationStatus_02_05": "I'll crush the bastard!",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_InvestigationStatus_Stop_15_01": "Relax, I know this man!",
  "DIA_Dennis_SQ116_InvestigationStatus_Stop_02_02": "So you planned it together! I'll deal with you both!",
  "DIA_Dennis_YouGood_15_01": "You're doing pretty good. Could you teach me something?",
  "DIA_Dennis_YouGood_03_02": "Do I look like someone who... Well, actually... if you'll spare the gold, I can teach you.",
  "DIA_Dennis_YouGood_03_03": "Not to brag, but I can pack a punch, and I used to practice long weapon combat. I probably still remember something.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Train_15_00": "Teach me.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Train_03_01": "Don't forget about payment.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Train_Back_03_00": "You already know something, but you still have some work ahead of you.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Train_Back_03_01": "It seems I can't teach you anything else.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Train_2H1_03_01": "It's not enough, bring more.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Train_2H5_03_01": "I won't change my vocation for that much.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Train_STR1_03_00": "It's not enough, bring more.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Train_STR5_03_00": "I won't change my vocation for that much.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Ambient_03_01": "Until Holdwig gets better, I'm not going to waste my time with idle chitchat.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Ambient_03_02": "Ever since Holdwig got back on his feet, things have started to go back on track. Admittedly, we're still struggling with one problem... but we'll get through it.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Ambient_03_03": "It's a shame it had to come to this, but at least now Holdwig will be able to rule his property in peace.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Ambient_03_04": "I have my doubts that Andreas will run the vineyard well, but who knows, maybe I'll get surprised.",
  "DIA_Dennis_Ambient_03_05": "Since Andreas and Holdwig started working together, the atmosphere has become extremely pleasant. Sometimes I even forget that there's still a war going on!",
