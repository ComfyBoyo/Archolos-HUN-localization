  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_15_01": "Here we are. Can we get started?",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_03_02": "Gentlemen for the play?",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_15_03": "Yes. Huug sent us. Is the Fire Ritual ready?",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_03_04": "I don't know any Huug, but if we're talking about some rituals, I invite you to join me in the ritual of 'Fire and Steel'.",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_03_05": "For the ritual to succeed, we need to drop some of the Paladin's blood. Preferably all of it.",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_15_06": "I should have seen it coming. You really think you can handle us?",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_03_07": "You? You misunderstand me. You young one can leave. Let's just say we're not in favor of royalty, especially its chivalrous representatives.",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_03_08": "Of course, our meeting must remain a sweet secret. If anyone finds out about it, you'll be in... trouble.",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_KillHim_15_01": "All right, he's yours.",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_KillHim_03_02": "Reasonable. I'm glad we were able to come to an agreement.",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_NoWay_15_01": "No way. I won't let you kill him.",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_Hello_NoWay_03_02": "Well, then you'll share his fate. Get them!",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_AfterFight_03_01": "Yeah! Two birds with one stone!",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_AfterFight_15_02": "Aren't you afraid I'll tell the fire mages everything?",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_AfterFight_03_03": "No. If you say anything to the mages, they'll accuse you of complicity and convict you. I suspect you're not too keen on a trip to the Valley of Mines, are you?",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_AfterFight_03_04": "And even if you are stupid enough to tell them something, my associates will find you very quickly in custody.",
  "DIA_Thug_CQ005_AfterFight_03_05": "And if you attack us, well, you will quickly share his fate."
