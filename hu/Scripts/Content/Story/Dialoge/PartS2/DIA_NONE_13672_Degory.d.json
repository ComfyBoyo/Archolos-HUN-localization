  "DIA_Degory_HELLO_15_01": "What are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Degory_HELLO_03_02": "We live. Get away from here or you'll get hurt!",
  "DIA_Degory_HELLO_15_03": "Relax, I'm not looking for a fight. I'm just surprised to see people in the sewers.",
  "DIA_Degory_HELLO_03_04": "And where were we supposed to go? In the city we were driven from corner to corner. Nobody wanted to help us.",
  "DIA_Degory_HELLO_03_05": "Better such a roof over your head than none at all!",
  "DIA_Degory_How_15_01": "How can you live under such conditions?",
  "DIA_Degory_How_03_02": "What do you think we should do? Wait for someone to slit our throat? Start stealing?",
  "DIA_Degory_How_03_03": "We may live like rats, but we will remain decent people.",
  "DIA_Degory_Why_15_01": "Why don't you look for some job?",
  "DIA_Degory_Why_03_02": "We're looking. Do you think we sit in this darkness all day?",
  "DIA_Degory_Why_03_03": "The problem is that nobody even wants to talk to us.",
  "DIA_Degory_Why_03_04": "People either avoid us or chase us away wherever we go. We're on our own. From all this, Giles started to freak out.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_Search_15_01": "I'm looking for a royal scout.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_Search_03_02": "Here? You're out of your mind.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_Search_03_03": "Unless you mean dead men. There's one lying here, or at least there was. The rats probably ate what was left of it.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_15_01": "Will you take me to him?",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_03_02": "I could do it, but not for free.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_15_03": "How much?",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_03_04": "And how much is that worth to you?",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_25_03_01": "How much? For that much, look for yourself.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_50_03_01": "All right. Follow me.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_200_03_01": "Oh, really? You'll give us that much gold?",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_200_03_02": "You don't realize how much you've helped us. This gold is enough for us to eat for a long time.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_200_15_03": "I'm glad, but I think we had to go somewhere.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_200_03_04": "Oh, yes, of course. Follow me.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_Leave_15_01": "I'll look for him myself.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_Leave_03_02": "Good luck - don't get yourself killed.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_Food_15_01": "I have some food with me.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_CanYouGuide_Food_03_02": "You think I'm stupid? Get the gold or look for it yourself.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_NearBody_03_01": "Is this the one?",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_NearBody_15_02": "I don't know. I have to check. Wait for me a second.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_NearBody_03_03": "I basically have nothing else to do.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_ItsHim_03_02": "What did you expect? He's been rotting here for a long time.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_ItsHim_15_03": "Do you know who appropriated his property?",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_ItsHim_03_04": "Are you serious? You can see for yourself that this body has been lying here for a long time. Literally anyone could have taken what he had with him.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_ItsHim_15_05": "This is very important to me.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_ItsHim_03_06": "Eh... let's go back to camp and talk to Giles.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_ItsHim_03_07": "Eh... go talk to Giles.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_ItsHim_03_08": "He knows these sewers the best from us, maybe he knows something.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_ItsHim_15_01": "This is the one, but his body was looted long ago.",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_FoundBody_03_01": "So, did you find your buddy?",
  "DIA_Degory_KQ405_FoundBody_15_02": "I did, but his body was looted long ago."
