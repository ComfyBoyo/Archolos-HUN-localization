  "DIA_Johan_Hello_15_01": "What are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_03_02": "Same thing I've been doing for over 20 years. I make sure people like you don't hang around here.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_03_03": "But the question is, what are YOU doing here?",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_LookingAround_15_01": "What is this place?",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_LookingAround_03_02": "Signal tower.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_LookingAround_03_03": "With it, the inhabitants of Archolos inform the other islands of the Archipelago of the impending danger.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_LookingAround_03_04": "As far as I'm concerned, this pile of rubble and boards is of no use to anyone, but an order is an order, so I sit here and freeze, because why not!",
  "DIA_Johan_SQ101_Bastian_Description": "Bastian sent me.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_BastianNeedWood_15_01": "Bastian sent me. The villagers are in urgent need of wood. As a result of the storm...",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_BastianNeedWood_03_02": "Blah, blah, blah. Storms, storms, and here we are, day after day, freezing like the bums from the Harbor District.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_BastianNeedWood_03_03": "Go to the woodcutters with it. They have a camp southeast of here. But there's a mountain range between us, so you'll have to walk a little further.",
  "DIA_Johan_Tower_15_01": "Tell me more about this tower.",
  "DIA_Johan_Tower_03_02": "You're one of us, so I guess I can tell you this and that.",
  "DIA_Johan_Tower_03_03": "Even when we witness a threat, we are not allowed to light fires until we receive an official order from the governor himself.",
  "DIA_Johan_Tower_03_04": "The accumulated supplies of wood and oil allow us to keep the fire going for a long time.",
  "DIA_Johan_Tower_03_08": "You are overly curious and I am slowly losing patience.",
  "DIA_Johan_Danger_15_01": "What threat are you talking about?",
  "DIA_Johan_Danger_03_02": "Robbers, pirates, plagues, and of course those orc bastards. In short, anything that could threaten the safety of the island and its surroundings.",
  "DIA_Johan_Danger_03_03": "Truth be told, no one remembers the last time the fires burned anymore.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_AlrightYouWon_15_01": "Okay, I'm not bothering you.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_WannaTalkAboutThis_15_01": "Maybe we can work something out?",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_WannaTalkAboutThis_03_02": "Are you just offering me a bribe, boy?",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_BastianWouldBeMad_15_01": "In that case, I'll make sure Bastian finds out about everything.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_BastianWouldBeMad_03_02": "He doesn't happen to be my commanding officer, so I don't owe him anything.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_BastianWouldBeMad_03_03": "And if he's so smart, let him chop his own wood. It's none of my business.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_WhatAboutThadWood_15_01": "And that wood up there? Why don't you give me twenty pieces?",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_WhatAboutThadWood_03_02": "And what if orc galleys appear on the horizon? Who will warn the city and the other islands then?",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_WhatAboutThadWood_03_03": "Forget about it.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_CowardWay_15_01": "You must have misheard.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_CowardWay_03_02": "I hope so. Now get out of here before I lose my patience.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_MaybeYouWantSomething_15_01": "I'm sure there's something you'd want for some wood.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_MaybeYouWantSomething_03_02": "Hmmm... It's so windy up there you can barely manage.",
  "DIA_Johan_Hello_MaybeYouWantSomething_03_03": "Get me Ghost Light, and we'll talk.",
  "DIA_Johan_SQ101_GotWispDrink_15_01": "Here, I brought you the Ghost Light.",
  "DIA_Johan_SQ101_GotWispDrink_03_02": "Well, that I understand!",
  "DIA_Johan_SQ101_GotWispDrink_03_03": "Thanks a lot, boy. I thought I was gonna freeze to death out here.",
  "DIA_Johan_SQ101_GotWispDrink_03_04": "Okay, follow me.",
  "DIA_Johan_SQ101_TakeWood_03_01": "Go inside and take one pile. No more.",
  "DIA_Johan_SQ101_TakeWood_03_02": "By the way, give my regards to Bastian.",
  "DIA_Johan_Thief_03_01": "You little thief, hands off!",
  "DIA_Johan_CanYouTeach_15_01": "But you must be ready to fend off such threats.",
  "DIA_Johan_CanYouTeach_03_02": "Absolutely. That's why I carry my beloved crossbow, which has never let me down yet.",
  "DIA_Johan_CanYouTeach_15_03": "Would you teach me how to use a weapon like that?",
  "DIA_Johan_CanYouTeach_03_04": "I don't have much to do here, so why not. But not for free, I'm not a loser!",
  "DIA_Johan_TRAIN_15_00": "I want to train.",
  "DIA_Johan_TRAIN_03_01": "Then find another teacher, because I can't show you anything anymore.",
  "DIA_Johan_TRAIN_03_02": "Okay, just get the gold ready.",
  "DIA_Johan_Train_CROSSBOW1_03_01": "It's not enough, bring more.",
  "DIA_Johan_Train_CROSSBOW1_03_02": "It's not enough, bring more.",
  "DIA_Johan_Train_CROSSBOW1_03_03": "I wouldn't lift a finger for that.",
  "DIA_Johan_Train_CROSSBOW1_03_04": "I wouldn't lift a finger for that.",
  "DIA_Johan_SQ101_Bastian_BastianWouldBeMad_Choice": "I'll make sure Bastian finds out about everything.",
  "DIA_Johan_SQ101_Bastian_ThadWood_Choice": "And that wood on the top?"
