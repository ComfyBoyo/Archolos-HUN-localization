  "DIA_Amir_Hello_15_01": "Hey, what are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_03_02": "I'm standing guard, what does it look like to you, you little chump?",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_What_15_01": "What are you guarding?",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_What_03_02": "Vlada's place.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_What_03_03": "Are you gonna get inside, or are you gonna keep bothering me?",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Who_15_01": "Chump?",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Who_03_02": "You heard right.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Who_03_03": "You look like a chump to me, like the rest of the people in this city.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Who_15_04": "You know, I'm not at all surprised that you were assigned guard duty outside the premises.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Who_03_05": "Yeah? Why would you think that, chump?",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Who_15_06": "Smelling like a sweaty mountain troll is sure to scare away all visitors.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Who_03_07": "Take it back, punk.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Who_15_08": "And if I don't, what then?",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Who_03_09": "Then with my own hands I'll open your skull and spit in it.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Sure_15_01": "You can try.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Sure_03_02": "Not only will I try, but I will do it.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Sorry_15_01": "I apologize.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Sorry_03_02": "Haha... Apology accepted, chump.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_ImIn_15_01": "I'm going in.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_ImIn_03_02": "You'd better not cause any trouble.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_ImIn_03_03": "There is no room for brawling on the premises, much less waving a weapon around.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_ImIn_03_04": "And remember, you only touch what you pay for. Is it clear?",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_ImIn_15_05": "Crystal clear.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hello_Later_15_01": "Maybe I'll stop by another time.",
  "DIA_Amir_Place_03_02": "Women, beer, booze and even more women.",
  "DIA_Amir_Vladan_15_01": "Who is Vlada?",
  "DIA_Amir_Vladan_03_02": "The brothel owner and my sister.",
  "DIA_Amir_Vladan_15_03": "You run a brothel with your sister? Interesting job.",
  "DIA_Amir_Vladan_03_04": "Vlada's got a head on her shoulders, so she's the boss. Me, I make sure no one uninvited wanders around her place.",
  "DIA_Amir_FightResult_03_01": "I told you you were a chump and I was right, chump.",
  "DIA_Amir_FightResult_15_02": "Let's see how you do the second time...",
  "DIA_Amir_FightResult_03_03": "The second time, well... there may not be a second time for you.",
  "DIA_Amir_FightResult_15_04": "What do you think, am I still a chump?",
  "DIA_Amir_FightResult_03_05": "I admit, you pack a punch... and you don't look like a fighter at all.",
  "DIA_Amir_FightResult_15_06": "Maybe now you can start treating others with respect.",
  "DIA_Amir_FightResult_03_07": "I'm not going to change my mind about this mangy city anyway.",
  "DIA_Amir_Rematch_15_01": "I think someone should give you a lesson in good manners.",
  "DIA_Amir_Rematch_03_02": "And that someone would be you?",
  "DIA_Amir_Rematch_03_03": "I warned you.",
  "DIA_Amir_From_15_01": "Where are you from?",
  "DIA_Amir_From_03_02": "From far away.",
  "DIA_Amir_From_15_03": "More specifically?",
  "DIA_Amir_From_03_04": "My sister and I grew up in a place you probably haven't even heard of...",
  "DIA_Amir_From_03_06": "So what's the point of having a name that you don't recognize and which will fly out of your head after a while anyway?",
  "DIA_Amir_From_03_07": "You just need to know that this was a place where without strength and cunning you could quickly end up with a knife stuck under your ribs.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hate_15_01": "Why do you dislike the locals so much?",
  "DIA_Amir_Hate_03_02": "Because they can't fight for what is dear to them.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hate_03_03": "Every day, I see the same faces visiting this brothel, partying and drinking themselves to death.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hate_15_04": "If you dislike this job so much, what are you still doing here?",
  "DIA_Amir_Hate_03_05": "I don't like, but I trust my sister. We've stuck together for many years and come out well on it.",
  "DIA_Amir_Hate_03_06": "Besides, we've already been separated once. I won't make the same mistake.",
  "DIA_Amir_Pieter_15_01": "I have a request for you.",
  "DIA_Amir_Pieter_03_02": "What do you want?",
  "DIA_Amir_Pieter_15_03": "Some scumbag keeps harassing Kathia.",
  "DIA_Amir_Pieter_15_04": "Could you politely tell him to leave her alone?",
  "DIA_Amir_Pieter_03_05": "I haven't seen him lay a hand on her or heard her complain, so as far as I'm concerned, everything is fine.",
  "DIA_Amir_Pieter_03_06": "I, in turn, have a little advice for you.",
  "DIA_Amir_Pieter_03_07": "Have a beer, watch the ladies, don't bother me with bullshit."
