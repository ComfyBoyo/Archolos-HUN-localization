  "DIA_Ewald_SQ22_IDontHaveTime_03_02": "I'm not likely to move from here anyway, so let me know if you change your mind.",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Yeah_03_02": "Actually, it's no big deal. Just a messenger job, delivering these bags and tools to a construction site.",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Yeah_03_03": "The problem is that I can't lift everything at once, I don't have a cart, and I can't leave it here either.",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Yeah_03_04": "As a reward, I'll give you half my payment. So what's it going to be, will you help?",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Yeah_15_01": "Sure, what needs to be done?",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_HellYeah_15_00": "All right, let's go.",

  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_03_01": "Okay, we're there. Now we can move on to signing the contract.",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_Thief_15_01": "Are you trying to rob me?",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_Thief_03_02": "Me? No way! As an exemplary member of the Merchant's Guild, I merely wanted to enter into a financial relationship with you.",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_Deal_15_01": "What deal?",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_Deal_03_02": "Your voluntary relinquishment of 200 gold pieces.",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_Deal_03_03": "I could see from a distance that you had a full purse. 200 coins won't make you poorer, and for me it will be an invaluable help!",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_NoWay_15_01": "I'm not giving you my gold!",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_NoWay_03_02": "Then we'll have to negotiate a bit. Boys, show him our arguments.",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_What_15_01": "What's in it for me?",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_What_03_02": "A face in one piece? The satisfaction of a profitable contract?",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_What_03_03": "They might also mention to some people in the Guild that you're a decent lad... it will certainly help you join us.",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_Give_03_03": "Just don't think of telling our superiors or we'll find you!",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_Give_15_01": "Give me that contract.",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_Trap_Give_03_02": "Business with you is a pleasure!",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_AfterFight_03_01": "You win! We'll leave you alone... With a punch like that, it's no wonder you have so much gold...",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_AfterFight_03_02": "And how did our arguments convince you? All this fuss is costing us money.",
  "DIA_Ewald_SQ220_AfterFight_03_03": "Unfortunately, that offer is no longer valid, we have seized all your gold as compensation. Have a nice day.",
  "DIA_Ewald_Ambient_03_01": "It would be better if someone would help me with an issue.",
  "DIA_Ewald_Ambient_03_02": "Not now, we have something to do, remember?",
  "DIA_Ewald_Ambient_03_03": "Did you come to make fun of me? Or do you want to punch me again?",
  "DIA_Ewald_Ambient_03_04": "Look who's here! You up for some new contract, kid?"
