  "DIA_ArmorSeller_Hello_03_03": "If you see anyone in town in anything that provides even a little bit of protection, it's definitely passed through my hands.",
  "DIA_ArmorSeller_Hello_03_04": "Now tell me, how can I help you? I sell armor, but I also make upgrades.",
  "DIA_ArmorSeller_Upgrade_15_01": "Armor upgrades?",
  "DIA_ArmorSeller_Upgrade_03_02": "Most armor is created to fit anyone.",
  "DIA_ArmorSeller_Upgrade_03_03": "I take it upon myself to carefully fit all the pieces and add extra reinforcements where needed.",
  "DIA_ArmorSeller_Upgrade_03_04": "This not only makes it more comfortable to move around in, but also provides more protection. Of course, this can't be done with every armor.",
  "DIA_ArmorSeller_Upgrade_03_05": "Just show me what you have and I'll tell you what we can do, what we'll need and how much it will cost.",
  "DIA_ArmorSeller_Teach_03_02": "And risk you putting me out of business? I'm not sharing my knowledge, nor am I looking for an apprentice."
