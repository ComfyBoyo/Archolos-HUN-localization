  "DIA_Ingor_NeedArmor_15_01": "I need an armor.",
  "DIA_Ingor_NeedArmor_03_02": "I currently have leather and chain armor in stock. The rest are undergoing major repairs or are reserved for Adelard's boys.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_Bolt_15_01": "What do you know about this bolthead?",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_Bolt_15_02": "Odgar claims that he has sharpened identical looking boltheads before. Apparently, he got them from one of the mercenaries.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_Bolt_03_03": "He got them from me, but as I was busy with work myself at the time, I gave the whole stock to Odgar.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_Bolt_15_04": "As mercenaries' armorer, you probably have exposure to weaponry from all over the world.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_Bolt_03_05": "That's true. I get unusual equipment quite often.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_Bolt_03_06": "A few months ago, I got an order to sharpen similar looking boltheads.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_WhoBolt_15_01": "Who ordered that?",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_WhoBolt_03_02": "Someone from the Wolf Den.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_WhoBolt_15_03": "Are you sure about this?",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_WhoBolt_03_04": "Those bolthead, like the one you brought, were covered with silver, and the only mine of that ore on the island is located there.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_WhoBolt_03_05": "Unless they brought them from outside the island, they had to be made by the blacksmiths there.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Q309_WhoBolt_15_06": "Thanks for your help.",
  "DIA_Ingor_NeedArmor_03_04": "Congratulations on your promotion! Catch, it's your new outfit!",
  "DIA_Ingor_NeedArmor_03_03": "You're moving up the career ladder, so you have higher and higher expectations. My job is to meet them!",
  "DIA_Ingor_Canyoutrain_15_01": "Could I train with you?",
  "DIA_Ingor_Canyoutrain_03_02": "Sure. I teach the rookies how to fight with heavy weapons, and I show our elites how to become stronger. Of course, if they already have some strength.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Train_15_00": "Let's train.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Train_03_01": "I wish I could, but unfortunately, I can't show you anything else. You're too good.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Train_03_02": "Get to work!",
  "DIA_Ingor_Train_2H1_03_01": "Slowly onward!",
  "DIA_Ingor_Train_2H5_03_01": "You're getting better!",
  "DIA_Ingor_TrainSTR1_03_00": "I only teach those who can no longer be counted as weaklings. Come some other time.",
  "DIA_Ingor_TrainSTR1_03_01": "Slowly onward.",
  "DIA_Ingor_TrainSTR5_03_00": "I only teach those who can no longer be counted as weaklings. Come some other time.",
  "DIA_Ingor_TrainSTR5_03_01": "You're getting better!",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_15_01": "I've come to pick up a book called 'Nordmarians' Mastery'.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_03_02": "And how do you know I have it?",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_15_03": "Adanos told me. How much for a copy?",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_03_04": "Well, it's a very rare work with valuable factual content, I can't part with it for half free just like that. But you will certainly be able to afford it.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_Militia_15_01": "I'm a servant of the law. You should give it to me for free. But, as I'm having a good day, I can pay you half the standard price.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_Militia_03_02": "Servants of the law without a warrant are bound by the same rules as other buyers. Don't try to fool me again, the people of Araxos know trade law by heart.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_Why_15_01": "And why would a blacksmith like you need such a book? You can probably make just as good or better equipment than what it describes.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_Why_03_02": "Ekhem, well, indeed, I have pretty good skills, certainly the best of all the city smiths.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_Why_03_03": "But it's always good to learn new techniques. You can't get stagnant because getting stagnant is the key to destroying your own business!",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_Smug_15_01": "Maybe so, but how long will I be unable to eat?",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_Smug_03_02": "They'll feed you there, don't you worry!",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_BuyBook_Description": "(Buy a book)",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_BuyBook_100_15_01": "Here, gold for the book.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_BuyBook_100_03_02": "Thank you very much. Unfortunately, I must ask you to come and pick up your copy tomorrow. We are just making more copies of the 'Nordmarians' Mastery'...",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_BuyBook_100_15_03": "If it's not here by tomorrow, I'll demand a partial refund.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_BuyBook_100_03_04": "Easy, easy, it'll be ready. See you later!",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_BookReady_15_01": "Is the book ready?",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_BookReady_03_02": "Indeed, here. May it serve you well!",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_BookReady_15_03": "It certainly will.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_BookReady_03_04": "Come some other time.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Teach_Smith_15_00": "Teach me the basics of blacksmithing.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Teach_Smith_03_01": "The basics are the materials. Even the best blacksmith won't make a good weapon out of just anything. You need to stock up on something decent, like this.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Teach_Smith_03_02": "When you have the right raw material, heat it up over the forge and then work it on the anvil. Following the instructions from the diagrams, you will create a simple weapon this way.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Teach_Smith_03_03": "Look, I know we belong to the same organization, but teaching blacksmithing is not my job. You have to pay.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Teach_Smith2_15_00": "Teach me better blacksmithing techniques.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Teach_Smith2_03_01": "Now that you know the basics, you can focus on perfecting your technique. Of course, to get proficient, you just have to forge on.",
  "DIA_Ingor_Teach_Smith2_03_02": "Set new challenges for yourself, try your hand with better diagrams, and by the gods, remember that weapons are for combat, not decoration. Practicality over appearance!",
  "DIA_Ingor_Teach_Smith2_03_03": "Look, I know we belong to the same organization, but teaching blacksmithing is not my job. You have to pay.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_Militia_Choice": "I'm an authority figure. You'll give it to me cheaper.",
  "DIA_Ingor_QM305_Book_Why_Choice": "And why would a blacksmith like you need a book like this?"
