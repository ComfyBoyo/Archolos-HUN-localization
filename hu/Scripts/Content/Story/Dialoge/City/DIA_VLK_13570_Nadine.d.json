  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Start_15_01": "Why are you sitting here like this?",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Start_03_02": "Finally someone wants to listen to me! Many days ago my daughter went missing. I continue to keep her corner of the house tidy...",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Start_03_03": "One day Lena just went out of town and the trace of her disappeared. I remember she was in her favorite dress. She looked beautiful in it.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Start_03_04": "The guards are said to have swept the whole town, but all to no avail, no trace!",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Start_03_05": "I even hired a tracker, but he vanished into thin air with all my savings.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Start_03_06": "I don't know how to deal with this. All I can think about is where she can be now!",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Nah_15_01": "Sorry, I can't help you.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Nah_03_02": "Like everyone else...",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Comprehension_Description": "I've also had a loved one kidnapped.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Comprehension_15_01": "I've also had a loved one kidnapped.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Comprehension_15_02": "I know how you feel.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Comprehension_15_03": "I could look around for your daughter on occasion.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Comprehension_03_04": "In that case, I'm glad I came across you.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Comprehension_03_05": "Everyone keeps telling me not to hope anymore. But a mother can never get over the loss of her child.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Comprehension_15_06": "I'll be back as soon as I've found something. I hope she's okay.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_Finish_15_01": "One more thing... I found this hunter.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_Finish_03_02": "I hope you told him off for cheating an old woman!",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_Finish_15_03": "That could be a problem. He's dead. He was very close, but something killed him in the swamp.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_Finish_03_04": "Oh... May Adanos forgive me for my words... Poor boy, I'll pray for him.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_15_01": "I have news.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_03_02": "Where's my daughter? Please don't tell me she's dead!",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_15_03": "She is free and recovering, but cannot leave the place she is currently in.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_03_04": "What do you mean, she's still a prisoner?",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_15_05": "In a way, yes, but it's better than sitting in a cell.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_15_06": "If it comforts you, know that her captors are dead.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_03_07": "I don't understand any of this!",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_15_08": "It's complicated. Lena asked me to tell you she's fine.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_03_09": "Knowing she's alive is enough for me. Please, keep it. I have no other way to reward you.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_TakeAmulet_15_01": "Sell it. It will help you get through the tough times.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_TakeAmulet_03_02": "I can't let you go without reward...",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_TakeAmuletForSure_15_01": "We both know you need it much more than I do.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_TakeAmuletForSure_03_02": "May Adanos protect you from evil.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_ThisAmuletIsMine_15_01": "Thank you. It'll come in handy.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_Finish_ThisAmuletIsMine_03_02": "When you wear it, remember us.",
  "DIA_Nadine_MyPoorDaughter_03_01": "My poor daughter...",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ507_Finish_03_01": "Thank you for helping get my daughter into the city! How good that there are still people like you and Barry on this island!",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ507_Finish_03_02": "I'll honestly admit that I wasn't too sure after our first conversation, but now I'm happy again!",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ507_Finish_03_05": "It's not much, but you deserve a reward!",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_LameFinish_03_01": "I'm so glad you're here. I have something to tell you.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_LameFinish_03_02": "No need to look around for Lena... My daughter recently came home!",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_LameFinish_15_03": "What do you mean?",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_LameFinish_03_04": "She was being held in some strange place in the swamp...",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_LameFinish_03_05": "They kept her in a cage - like an animal! But finally Adanos took pity on her.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_LameFinish_03_06": "As the kidnapper was carrying her food, he suddenly slumped to the ground. My daughter decided to seize the moment and ran away.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_LameFinish_03_07": "But one day there was some kind of battle there!",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_LameFinish_03_08": "The bandits were defeated by the guard and Araxos... A boy found my daughter in the chaos and led her to the city.",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_LameFinish_03_09": "Everything ended well, but Lena is very tired...",
  "DIA_Nadine_SQ316_LameFinish_03_10": "You tried to help, so accept this as a thank you."
