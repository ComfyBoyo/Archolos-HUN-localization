  "DIA_Lazar_Grave_GoAway_15_01": "The problem is that I don't particularly like sharing with others - especially with dug up corpses.",

  "DIA_Lazar_Grave_How_03_02": "Let me think...",
  "DIA_Lazar_Grave_How_03_03": "Maybe because you sneaked into a cemetery in the middle of the night and dug up that little boy?",

  "DIA_Lazar_GotBolt_No_03_02": "What? What are you talking about?",
  "DIA_Lazar_GotBolt_No_15_03": "I won't leave this boy's body to the mercy of a grave robber, and you will come with me, nice and slow.",
  "DIA_Lazar_GotBolt_No_15_04": "The commander will be pleased when I bring him a scumbag like you.",
  "DIA_Lazar_GotBolt_No_15_05": "The guards will thank me when I bring them a scumbag like you.",
  "DIA_Lazar_GotBolt_No_15_06": "Who knows, maybe they'll even reward me?",
