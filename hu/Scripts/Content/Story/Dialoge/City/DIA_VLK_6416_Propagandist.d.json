  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Yes_15_01": "Why not.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Yes_03_02": "Keep it, it's free.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_What_15_01": "What's in it?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_What_03_02": "Only the truth itself!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_What_03_03": "Instead of asking me, just read it.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_From_15_01": "Where did you get those flyers?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_From_03_02": "For a mercenary, you're very curious. A little too much.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_From_03_03": "They fell into my hands, so I'm giving them away.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_From_03_04": "Now get out of here because I have a lot on my mind.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Talk_15_01": "Oh, I hate those vagrants. They should send them back where they came from!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Talk_03_02": "You took that right out of my mouth, friend. Unfortunately, all indications are that the governor will take them in.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Talk_03_03": "And that's just the beginning of the problems!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Talk_15_04": "What do you mean by that?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Talk_03_05": "I know from a certain source that a Royal Envoy will be arriving in the city any day now.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Talk_15_06": "Envoy? No way!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Talk_03_07": "Yeah, The Envoy. They say he comes from the capital itself!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Talk_03_08": "This is why the authorities are keen to disperse the refugees quickly.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Problem_15_01": "If the Envoy saw all that mess in the harbor, the governor would have a problem.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Problem_03_02": "And not a small one at that. Maybe he would even be dismissed?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Problem_15_03": "Or hauled off in a wheelbarrow.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Problem_03_04": "On the one hand, it's the law to help all the people of the kingdom, on the other hand, Morris isn't so stupid as to let these stinkers out.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Problem_15_05": "What's certain is that he won't let go of his job. Or the taxpayers' gold.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Problem_03_06": "Therefore, he will do everything to create the guise of order.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Problem_03_07": "The question is, what awaits us once this Envoy has sailed?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Problem_03_08": "Nothing good in my opinion.",

  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Who_03_03": "I've heard rumors.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Who_03_04": "Now get out of here because I have a lot on my mind.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_WhatCan_15_01": "What can we, the common people, do about it?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_WhatCan_03_02": "Everything. We are, after all, bloody citizens of this city!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_WhatCan_03_03": "You wear Guild armor, but I can tell by your mouth and words that you're a decent guy.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_WhatCan_03_04": "I have no idea who you are, but I can tell by your mouth and words that you are a decent guy.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_WhatCan_03_05": "People need to be made aware of how things work. The more of us there are, the harder it will be for the guards to chase us away.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_WhatCan_03_06": "Ludlof should be speaking near the shipyard now. Apparently, he's supposed to organize some kind of protest in the market later.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_WhatCan_03_07": "Go to him if you want to help, just remember - you didn't hear it from me, okay?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_WhatCan_15_08": "Sure thing. Thanks for the tip.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_15_01": "I got you!",

  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_15_03": "Who gave you those pamphlets? Talk to me, but don't play games this time.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_03_04": "Lu-Ludlof... it was Ludlof.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_15_05": "Ludlof?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_03_06": "Another sp-speaker.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_15_07": "Where is he?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_03_08": "In the ha-h-ha-ha-harbor, b-behind the shipyard.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_15_09": "Thank you so much.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_03_10": "N-now will you let m-me go?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_GoAway_15_01": "If I ever see you handing out those pieces of paper again, I won't be so nice.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_GoAway_03_02": "O-Oh, of course. I'm-I'm-I'm gone!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_GoAway_15_03": "Get out of here.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_Fight_15_01": "With worms like you, there's only one thing to do.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_Fight_03_02": "Wh-wh-what?!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_Fight_15_03": "Crush them.",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_Fight_03_04": "Ju-just try to t-touch me, stinker!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_Fight_03_05": "I ha-have f-friends... h-high-profile friends...!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_GotYou_Fight_03_06": "B-b-be-be-be-besides, you do-don't have the balls for it!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_Scare_Description": "Talk, where did you get those brochures?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_Scare_15_01": "You must feel pretty damn brave among all those people, huh? You think they'll protect you?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_Scare_03_02": "What?",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_Scare_15_03": "If you don't tell me right now where you got those pamphlets, I will smack your face right here where you're standing!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_Scare_03_04": "Hahahahahahahahaha!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_Scare_03_05": "Try to catch me, loser!",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Yes_Talk_Choice": "(Chat)",
  "DIA_Propagandist02_HELLO_Yes_Talk_Problem_Choice": "The governor has a problem.",
