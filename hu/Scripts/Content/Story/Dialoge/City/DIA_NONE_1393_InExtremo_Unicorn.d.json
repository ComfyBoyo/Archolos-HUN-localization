  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_03_02": "Thank you for coming out in such large numbers! We'll play for you until the end of the war and one day more!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_03_03": "Remember. The law is for the people, not the people for the law!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_03_04": "Let us not make concessions. Let's fight for ourselves!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_03_05": "The punishment must be appropriate to the act! Does a man in misery and desperation deserve the highest penalty?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_03_07": "So what can you do dear citizens of Archolos?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_03_08": "What will you answer, honorable citizens of Archolos?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_03_09": "Rhobar II! The people of Archolos have spoken! Come to your senses! We do not want your vision of Myrtana!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_03_10": "Fight for yourselves! You make this kingdom!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_03_11": "Thank you people of Archolos! We would love to play for you again!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V1_A_15_01": "Down with the bad law! He speaks well!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V1_A_03_02": "We, the citizens of Myrtana, are the law and our opinion should be respected!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V1_B_15_01": "Till we're alive, Rhobar II will be vilified!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V1_B_03_02": "I understand your emotions. Let's not get carried away! Remember that each of us can do something for the kingdom!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V1_C_15_01": "This is not the Myrtana we fight for!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V1_C_03_02": "The young man is right! What are our loved ones shedding blood for at the front? Not for lack of justice!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V2_A_15_01": "No! Every case is different!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V2_A_03_02": "Bravo, young man! There is no single judgment for all of us!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V2_B_15_01": "Rhobar will not spit in our faces!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V2_B_03_02": "Don't say such words. The King should be respected!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V2_C_15_01": "Beliar take those who pass such laws!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V2_C_03_02": "Like you I am agitated, but let us not insult our good Monarch!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V3_A_15_01": "Revolt! Free Archolos!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V3_A_03_02": "Someone's trying to provoke us here! You will not succeed!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V3_B_15_01": "Oppose!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V3_B_03_02": "Yes! Express your concerns. Express your dissatisfaction. Together we are a force to be reckoned with!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V3_C_15_01": "Don't obey the law!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V3_C_03_02": "You misunderstand my words! Oppose only the lack of justice!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V4_A_15_01": "We demand justice!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V4_A_03_02": "What a great crowd! Let's make sure justice triumphs!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V4_B_15_01": "Death to the traitors of Myrtana!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V4_B_03_02": "You're wrong! Those responsible for this law are not traitors - they went astray in an effort to save the kingdom.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V4_C_15_01": "We don't want a King like that!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Concert_Tease_V4_C_03_02": "It is not for us to choose our ruler.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_NiceConcert_15_01": "Amazing concert!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_NiceConcert_03_02": "It's always nice to hear that from our audience.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_NiceConcert_03_03": "You, on the other hand, screamed wonderfully!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_NiceConcert_03_04": "You overreacted at times, but it's clear we're on the same side of the barricade.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_NiceConcert_03_05": "I can't fully agree with your slogans, but I think we think alike.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Law_15_01": "Do you not like the new royal law?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Law_03_02": "Do you know anyone who likes it? Beside royal lapdogs.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Law_03_03": "I have heard of people who have been forced into slave labor for mere slander.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Law_03_04": "All the king cares about is who gets to dig his precious ore. Justice has long ceased to matter.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Law_15_05": "Criticism of King could end badly for you.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Law_03_06": "That's why we're careful. We don't want to slave over for the King's benefit.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Law_03_07": "On the other hand, it is a pity that we cannot talk about it openly. We could have used stronger means of expression.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Description": "What if there was someone who could quietly help you?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_15_01": "What if someone came along who was not affiliated with you and could quietly help?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_03_02": "Do you know anyone like that?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_15_03": "I was talking about myself.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_03_04": "That kind of thing coming from the mouth of a city guard? Maybe I should report this to Roderich?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_03_05": "Forgive me, but I have little confidence in the people of Araxos. You do nothing without having an interest in it.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_03_06": "I don't even know you. Why should I trust you?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Next_03_01": "Well, let's live and see. We'll see if you're as useful as you claim.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Next_03_02": "I don't have an idea for anything big. I'd like our next show to stick with the people of Archolos for years to come.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Next_03_03": "At the same time, you know we can't over do it. The King's dogs are just waiting for us to make a mistake.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_MilQuest_15_01": "The King tried to trick us. He wanted to take all our equipment, and in return he offered us a pile of rusty iron.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_MilQuest_03_02": "Are you talking about those dresses? Yeah, I've seen your friends parading around in them. It was a lot of fun.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Tell_15_01": "Say whatever you want. The very fact that I serve the people of Archolos proves my good intentions.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Tell_03_02": "What do you take me for? An idiot? Get out of here, provocateur!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_SLDQuest_15_01": "We have a great relationship with King. So much so, that thanks to him we miraculously avoided being thrown out of our own headquarters.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_SLDQuest_03_02": "That's how it ends to deal with our beloved ruler Rhobar II.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Fleet_15_01": "Did you hear about the confiscation of the fleet? We came out of that decree brilliantly.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Fleet_03_02": "Yes, and at the same time you have pledged your allegiance to the crown. Forgive me, but I see no room for cooperation here.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Life_15_01": "The war destroyed my life. If Rhobar had been a better ruler, the war would never have reached the archipelago.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Life_15_02": "I don't know you either, and I don't know what happened to you, but this conflict has destroyed my whole life.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Life_15_03": "If I can get payback in any way, I will happily do so.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Life_03_04": "That's the kind of motivation I understand!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Business_15_01": "I'm looking for easy money.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Business_03_02": "Given your outcries and the fact that you are not affiliated with any organization, you seem suspicious.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Business_03_03": "I have many things to do, leave me alone.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Help_15_01": "How about... making your show even better?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Help_03_02": "Do you have something specific in mind?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Help_15_03": "Some element of the stage performance that would directly address the new law.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Help_03_04": "Wait, wait... it's a thought! I think I have an idea!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Help_15_05": "So when do we start?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Help_03_06": "We? There's no 'we', at least for now.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Help_03_07": "You're gonna get us some small things. How you get them is your problem.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Help_03_08": "Wait, I'll write you a list.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Help_03_09": "No one can prove that one of us wrote it. Please read it.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_15_01": "As for the list...",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_What_15_01": "I read your list. What are you planning?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_What_03_02": "You'll find out in your own time. Complete the list first, and perhaps I'll fill you in later.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_FireMage_Search_15_01": "Where am I going to get a Fire Mage's robe? I doubt they'll sell it to me.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_FireMage_Search_03_02": "It's not my problem anymore. You're up to it.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_Woodcutter_Search_15_01": "Why do you need a woodcutter's outfit?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_Woodcutter_Search_03_02": "I don't mean a woodcutter's outfit.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_Woodcutter_Search_15_03": "I don't understand any of this anymore.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_Woodcutter_Search_03_04": "It's about a worker's outfit. Woodcutter is the first thing that came to mind.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_Woodcutter_Search_03_05": "It could be something different. Like I said, it's up to you to prove yourself, so think for yourself.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_VLKRich_Search_15_01": "You want a rich merchant's outfit?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_VLKRich_Search_03_02": "Yes, as you probably know, we have a tailor in town. I'm sure he can sell you one.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_RhobarKing_Search_15_01": "Why do you need the armor of a royal guardsman?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_RhobarKing_Search_03_02": "You'll see, but there may be a problem with this one.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_RhobarKing_Search_03_03": "Real art requires sacrifices! You'll think of something!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_GotEverything_15_01": "The list is complete.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_GotEverything_03_02": "I really didn't think you'd succeed. Especially with the Fire Mages' robes.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_15_01": "Will I finally find out what this is all about?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_03_02": "You risked a lot to get all this for us. That's why I'll trust you.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_03_03": "As you well know, the royal authority will do anything to provoke us and send us to the colony. We can't let that shut our mouths.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_03_04": "We will play again in the same place. This time, the event will be forever burned into the minds of the people of Archolos.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_03_05": "You will dress up as a royal guardsman...",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_Wait_15_01": "What did you say?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_Wait_03_02": "Don't interrupt. We're going to do a little scene before the concert.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_Wait_03_03": "A scene in which a poor worker must steal to survive war time, and for this offense, he will be sent to the colony by the Fire Mages!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_Wait_15_04": "Theater. That's great. You have a part planned for me too, I take it?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_Wait_03_05": "You have no stage experience, you're unfit. You'll dress up as a guardsman and pretend to guard us.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_Wait_03_06": "Invoke the orders of the Emissary himself. Assert that we are invulnerable!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_Wait_03_07": "By the time they realize you've been planted, the show will be over.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_What_Wait_03_08": "And then we'll hole up in a quiet place for a while and wait for things to die down.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_LetsGo_15_01": "I'm in!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_LetsGo_03_02": "Great! Come join us whenever you're ready.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_BigConcertReady_15_01": "I'm ready.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_BigConcertReady_03_02": "I see. Do not, under any circumstances, let the Guardsmen approach us until we've finished playing!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_BigConcertReady_03_03": "What are you waiting for? Put on your armor!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_BigConcertReady_03_04": "Let's get this show on the road!",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_MilQuest_Choice": "The king wanted to deceive us.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Tell_Choice": "Tell him whatever you want.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_SLDQuest_Choice": "Thanks to the king, we almost became homeless.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Fleet_Choice": "Did you hear about the confiscation of the fleet?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Life_Choice": "The war destroyed my life.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_Someone_Business_Choice": "I'm looking for easy money.",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_RhobarKing_Search_Choice": "Why do you need the armor of a Royal Guardsman?",
  "DIA_InExtremo_Unicorn_KQ404_List_FireMage_Search_Choice": "Where will I get the Fire Mage's robe?"
