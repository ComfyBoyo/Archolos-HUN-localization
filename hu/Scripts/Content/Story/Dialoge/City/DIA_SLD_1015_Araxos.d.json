  "DIA_Araxos03_AraxosJoin_03_02": "Sure, I'm always happy to help my own! You did a pretty good job with our booze, I must say! Better than me, and I've been making it myself for years!",
  "DIA_Araxos03_AraxosJoin_03_03": "For personal use only, of course!",
  "DIA_Araxos03_AraxosJoin_15_04": "Mmm... so?",
  "DIA_Araxos03_AraxosJoin_03_05": "Perform your duties diligently, with humility. Some people find it annoying to fly from town to vineyard on the way stopping by Bermar's farm, but such is the fate of every newbie.",

  "DIA_Araxos03_AraxosJoin_03_07": "Also, remember not to fly to commanders with anything. Many mercenaries of higher rank will laugh at you, but complaining about it will do you far more harm than good.",
