  "DIA_Araxos02_AraxosJoin_03_02": "Quite a lot, but first admit it: it's nice to be in an organization where they give you free booze and weed at the very start, isn't it?",
  "DIA_Araxos02_AraxosJoin_15_03": "Sure... now it's nice, let's see what happens in the morning.",
  "DIA_Araxos02_AraxosJoin_03_04": "Fear not, there is no hangover after the guild hooch!",
  "DIA_Araxos02_AraxosJoin_03_05": "Because it's so strong, you'll have time to drink something again before you get real sober.",
  "DIA_Araxos02_AraxosJoin_03_06": "Okay, but to the point.",
  "DIA_Araxos02_AraxosJoin_03_07": "You are not the armed arm of the Guild. You are one of the mercenaries, but as a runner, you are not meant for combat or protection assignments.",
  "DIA_Araxos02_AraxosJoin_03_08": "You can take such orders, but you do it at your own risk. You can't hold a grudge against anyone if you throw yourself at a group of thugs and get mugged.",
