  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_14_01": "I'll do anything not to work for that pissant Florin.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_15_02": "You have a problem with the authority?",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_14_03": "What about you? Did you fall out of a tree?",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_14_04": "Anyone who cares about improving the livelihood of this sunken hole should have a problem with the King, doggone it!",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_15_05": "You think things are bad in politics?",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_14_06": "Bad is an understatement. Power favours the wealthy and exploits the poor, this has been known for a long time!",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_14_07": "Besides, why the hell should we die in a war that we shouldn't care about at all?",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_14_08": "Power should be in the hands of the people, that's what! Maybe then everyone would live better!",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_14_09": "Just as once, the people elected Volfzack, so now, the people should elect governors.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_True_15_00": "You're kind of right.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_True_14_01": "Heh. Too bad we're in the minority, but that will change soon. I'm sure it will.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Orcs_15_00": "You'll change your mind when the orcs knock on your door.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Orcs_14_01": "Are you one of this asshole's agitators that you are so frothing? Or are royal coins clouding your vision?",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Orcs_15_02": "Rather, that's what reason tells me.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Orcs_14_03": "You're just as stupid as the rest of them!",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Jail_15_00": "Aren't you afraid you might end up behind bars?",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Jail_14_01": "For what?",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Jail_15_02": "Your slogans may not appeal to everyone.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Jail_14_03": "What else can they do to me? Life has robbed me of everything I had!",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Jail_15_04": "The guards won't go easy on you.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Jail_14_05": "I'll tell you what, snot.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Jail_14_06": "The sheep, they will always sit quietly, even as they are butchered. One by one.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Jail_14_07": "And now comes the time of wolves.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Bye_15_00": "That's all.",
  "DIA_Arnold_Ambient_Job_Bye_14_01": "Wise decision.",
  "DIA_Arnold_RevengeTime_03_01": "Remember us?",
  "DIA_Arnold_RevengeTime_03_02": "Because we remember you!",
