  "DIA_Odgar_HELLO_03_01": "I offer the best weapons in town - at the right price, of course.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_15_01": "What makes your weapons so good?",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_03_02": "I won't lie - years of practice. There is no great philosophy to it though.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_03_03": "I forge weapons using methods that have been known for generations, dating back to Volfzack himself.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_03_04": "They involve hardening the blade several times and choosing the right proportions of iron and charcoal.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_03_05": "The key is to achieve extremely durable yet flexible steel that will not break due to a violent impact.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_Teach_15_01": "I happen to have learned a thing or two about blacksmithing in my life.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_Teach_15_02": "Could you explain to me what exactly these methods consist of?",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_Teach_03_03": "Unfortunately, boy, I don't reveal my techniques.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_Teach_03_04": "Besides, this is knowledge that takes years to acquire, often by trial and error. I would have to take you on as an apprentice, and you would have to be a diligent student.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_Teach_03_05": "The problem is, I don't need help right now.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Weapon_Teach_03_06": "But as you well know, I already have one.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRADE_15_01": "What do you have for sale?",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRADE_03_02": "You'll find only the best blades on Archolos.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_15_01": "I'd like to join the city guard...",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_07_02": "Let me guess, they ran out of weapons again?",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_15_03": "Looks like it. Could you forge it for me?",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_07_04": "Maybe I could, but I have some other jobs on my mind.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_07_05": "Tell me, boy, do you know anything about blacksmithing?",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_KnowSmithing_15_00": "I can do something, but you'd probably laugh at the sight of my work.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_KnowSmithing_07_01": "Well, the sword of the guard is not too difficult to make, even for a beginner.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_KnowSmithing_07_02": "I can sell you the blueprint, and if you buy me a good beer, I'll even watch you work and give you some tips.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_KnowSmithing_07_03": "I invite you to dig a few gold pieces out of your purse, you won't regret it.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_15_06": "Unfortunately, no.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_07_07": "Too bad. I'll have to make the sword myself, so the price will be higher. And you'll have to bring me the right materials.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_15_08": "Which are?",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_07_09": "You've got the ingredient list right here. And remember, with the prospect of a good beer after work, I'm better off forging ahead!",
  "DIA_Odgar_SwordScheme_No_15_01": "I need to think about this some more.",
  "DIA_Odgar_SwordScheme_No_10_02": "Suit yourself.",
  "DIA_Odgar_SwordScheme_Yes_15_01": "Sure, here you go.",
  "DIA_Odgar_SwordScheme_Yes_10_02": "Take it!",
  "DIA_Odgar_SwordScheme_Yes_10_03": "Come back when you have all the materials you need. And beer!",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_ActuallyYes_15_01": "I want to buy this blueprint.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_ActuallyYes_10_02": "Here it is.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_ActuallyYes_10_03": "And remember, if you come with the right materials, well, and a good beer, I'll be happy to help you with your work!",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_SmithingTogether_10_02": "Then we can get to work. Heat up the steel and start forging!",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_SmithingTogether_10_03": "Yes, as I mentioned earlier, a guard's sword is a simple weapon, and it is in this simplicity that the strength lies! It is sturdy, durable, and very comfortable!",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_Smithing_Yes_10_02": "I'm on it.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_Smithing_15_01": "I already have all the materials I need.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_Smithing_10_02": "In that case, give me the money and I'll get to work. And let's not forget the beer!",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_Smithing_No_15_01": "I'll bring it later.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_Smithing_No_10_02": "Suit yourself.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_Smithing_Yes_15_01": "Here.",
  "DIA_Odgar_AfterSmithingTogether_GreatBeer_10_01": "Ah, there's nothing like a cold beer after a few hours of work!",
  "DIA_Odgar_AfterSmithingTogether_10_04": "Let's see what you got up there...",
  "DIA_Odgar_AfterSmithingTogether_10_05": "Well, well, it's not bad! I think it won't embarrass you among your colleagues.",
  "DIA_Odgar_AfterSmithingTogether_10_06": "It needs some polishing though, give me a minute!",
  "DIA_Odgar_AfterSmithingTogether_10_07": "Here, it's yours.",
  "DIA_Odgar_AfterSmithingTogether_10_08": "Let me take another look at my work...",
  "DIA_Odgar_AFTERPARTY_15_01": "I would like to reforge my sword into a two handed one.",
  "DIA_Odgar_AFTERPARTY_03_02": "Oh. And what about it?",
  "DIA_Odgar_AFTERPARTY_15_03": "Could I use your forge?",
  "DIA_Odgar_AFTERPARTY_03_04": "Use it, but don't mess things up for me! I'm not going to look for a hammer all day!",
  "DIA_Odgar_AFTERPARTY_15_05": "Could you take care of that?",
  "DIA_Odgar_AFTERPARTY_03_06": "Sure. I'm a blacksmith, so my job is to forge.",
  "DIA_Odgar_AFTERPARTY_03_07": "It should be ready for tomorrow.",
  "DIA_Odgar_AFTERPARTY_03_08": "Bring your sword and we'll do something.",
  "DIA_Odgar_SwordReady_15_01": "My sword ready?",
  "DIA_Odgar_SwordReady_03_02": "Yes, here you go.",
  "DIA_Odgar_SwordReady_03_03": "May it serve you well. And, of course, the people of the city.",
  "DIA_Odgar_SwordReady_03_04": "No. I told you to come in the morning.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Nice2HSword_03_01": "Quite a sword.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Nice2HSword_03_02": "May it serve you well. And, of course, the people of the city.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_15_01": "I need your opinion on a certain bolt head.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_03_02": "A bolt head, you say?",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_03_03": "Let me see that baby.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_03_04": "It's not my work or any city smith's work.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_15_01": "In that case, who made it?",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_03_02": "I rarely see boltheads of this shape and texture on the market.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_03_03": "As on some blades, the spikes are designed to inflict lacerating wounds and pierce very tough armor. Silver, on the other hand...",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_03_04": "...I don't know why anyone needs silver on their bolts.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_03_05": "This is quite valuable and rare material for this island.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_03_06": "If I were you, I'd look around among mercenaries.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_03_07": "If my memory serves me right, I once sharpened boltheads for one of you that looked almost identical.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_03_08": "If I were you, I'd look around among mercenaries.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_03_09": "If my memory serves me right, I once sharpened boltheads for one of them that looked almost identical.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_15_10": "Thanks a lot for your help.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Bolt_Who_03_11": "The pleasure's all mine, boy.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Canyoutrainme_15_01": "Can you teach me anything else?",
  "DIA_Odgar_Canyoutrainme_03_02": "Sure. Like any blacksmith, I know a thing or two about gaining strength quickly, and I can show you how it's done.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Canyoutrainme_03_03": "For a few gold pieces, of course. Times are hard, and you have to buy bread for a living.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Train_15_01": "Let's start training.",
  "DIA_Odgar_train_03_02": "Get to work!",
  "DIA_Odgar_train_03_03": "Huh, you know, I'm old, and that means limitations. I can't teach a youngster like you any more.",
  "DIA_Odgar_train_03_04": "You're a strong guy, you'll be better than me in no time!",
  "DIA_Odgar_train_03_05": "I need this money for retirement, don't be so stingy!",
  "DIA_Odgar_train_03_06": "I've already given you a discount because of your position, and you still don't have enough on you?",
  "DIA_Odgar_train_03_07": "I need this money for retirement, don't be so stingy!",
  "DIA_Odgar_train_03_08": "I've already given you a discount because of your position, and you still don't have enough on you?",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_15_01": "Grayson sent me.",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_03_02": "If so, I can expect a big order!",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_15_03": "Look at this. How long will it take you to fix it?",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_03_04": "Hmmm completely rusted. Wait a minute! That's not rust! What are you thinking?",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_15_05": "Quiet, you fool! You want to make double?",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_03_06": "Who wouldn't? Perhaps you'd like to explain to me what this is all about?",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_15_07": "Grayson wanted to introduce these armors for use in the guard.",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_15_08": "As you can guess we in the guard didn't like that very much.",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_03_09": "It's not a solid job. Cheap replacement compared to what you currently have.",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_15_10": "Here's the deal. You'll take an order from Grayson. You'll discuss the financial terms with him personally.",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_15_11": "Tell him, please, that you will need a few months to get all the pieces in order.",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_15_12": "Roderich and the rest of the guard will surely return the favor.",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_03_13": "I've worked with the guard for so many years now, it would be a shame to lose a customer like that.",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_03_14": "Agreed, but tell Roderich to get a fat purse ready.",
  "DIA_Odgar_KQ402_Grayson_03_15": "Tell Grayson I'll be there as soon as I can.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_15_01": "I want to work for you.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_03_02": "What? What do you mean? Why?",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_15_03": "Apparently, becoming someone's apprentice is the best way to make quick and honest money.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_03_04": "Eh, I need to talk to Matey about who he's sending to me. But since you're here, well, I'll give you a chance.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_03_05": "Use it well because I don't like anyone wasting my time.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_15_06": "Then what do you want me to do for you?",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_03_07": "Eh, I don't know, I don't have time to come up with tests. Impress me somehow, and that's it!",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_15_08": "Aha.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_15_09": "It's better to have several sources of income these days. I don't want to end up on the pavement, and with one job, that would be quite likely.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_03_10": "Yeah, yeah, but as far as I know, you've already got a steady job. Don't count on me to get you anything long-term.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_15_11": "I understand, it's always something.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_03_12": "I welcome your enthusiasm. Now impress me in a way that makes it worth paying you.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_15_13": "More specifically?",
  "DIA_Odgar_Peon_03_14": "I don't know, go ahead. You're young, you've got a keen mind, you'll figure it out. Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.",
  "DIA_Odgar_BePeon_03_01": "If you're willing, I can take you on as an apprentice.",
  "DIA_Odgar_EnoughWork_03_01": "You know, I think I've had enough of your work. You did a pretty good job, I must say. Here's your payment.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_15_01": "I have an idea...",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Iron_15_01": "I have some unprocessed iron here.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Iron_03_02": "Amazing! How did you manage to get it? I can't remember the last time I was this impressed!",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Iron_15_03": "Okay, okay, save it.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Nugget_15_01": "I have a nugget of magic ore here.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Nugget_03_02": "Magic ore? How did you get it? After all, the King requisitions every piece and takes it to the mainland!",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Nugget_15_03": "I have my ways.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Nugget_03_04": "Heck, even with that one nugget I'll be able to test its properties.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Nugget_03_05": "That's what I meant by impressive. Good job, boy.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Coal_15_01": "I got some coal for you.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Coal_03_02": "Great, there'll be something to fire up the forge. I just hope you weren't trying to impress me with that, huh?",
  "DIA_Odgar_IwanttobePeon_15_01": "I want to be your apprentice.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IwanttobePeon_03_02": "Good, 'cause I could use you. But once you've made up your mind, don't get picky, okay?",
  "DIA_Odgar_IwanttobePeonNotSure_15_01": "I'll think about it some more.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IwanttobePeonNotSure_03_02": "Not too long. I'm not gonna spend my whole life waiting.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IwanttobePeonYes_15_01": "Yes, I'm sure.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IwanttobePeonYes_03_05": "You are charged with a crime!",
  "DIA_Odgar_IwanttobePeonYes_03_06": "Go to Roderich and settle this matter, only then will I accept you as an apprentice.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IwanttobePeonYes_03_02": "Very well, then! From now on, you're my apprentice. I hope I won't regret it.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IwanttobePeonYes_15_03": "I'll do my best, do not worry.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IwanttobePeonYes_03_04": "Sure, don't worry, with today's youth...",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_15_01": "What are my responsibilities?",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_03_04": "Well, I guess my relationship with Roderich is so good he sends his own to help.",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_03_05": "I never thought someone from Araxos would work for me. But so be it, it's always some new experience.",
  "DIA_Odgar_WhoaYouMilitia_03_01": "You joined the guard, huh?",
  "DIA_Odgar_WhoaYouMilitia_03_02": "Very well, the guard must grow in strength, otherwise this island would descend into chaos. Let's just hope your choice means I can give you some special assignments too.",
  "DIA_Odgar_WhoaYouAraxos_03_01": "You joined Araxos?",
  "DIA_Odgar_WhoaYouAraxos_03_02": "I won't say I particularly respect your choice, but do what you want, it's your life. Let's just hope your choice means I can give you some special assignments too.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IHaveWeapon_03_02": "Okay, show me.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IHaveWeapon_03_03": "Pretty good, kid.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IHaveWeapon_03_04": "Well, and now I see you're trying.",
  "DIA_Odgar_IHaveWeapon_03_05": "Oh heck, you must have worked hard!",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_01": "Forge as many weapons as you can, and I'll gladly pay you for each. The better equipment you bring me, the more gold you'll get.",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_02": "Just don't bring me dozens of the same weapons. The market doesn't need that.",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_15_03": "I thought working for a blacksmith would be more challenging.",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_04": "You think this is easy? Okay, since you want a challenge, I'll give you a special assignment.",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_15_05": "Should I forge something special?",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_06": "No, not this time.",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_07": "A few days ago a traveler visited me. He wanted to sell a blueprint for an interesting weapon, but demanded far too much. I refused.",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_08": "I thought about it overnight and decided it wasn't the best decision. Your job is to find him and buy back the blueprint.",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_15_09": "Any tips on where he might be?",
  "DIA_Odgar_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_10": "He said something about hunting mountain trolls, and the guards saw him walking towards the Amber Coast.",
  "DIA_Odgar_WhoaYouMilitia_15_03": "No doubt about it. As soon as you have something, let me know.",
  "DIA_Odgar_WhoaYouMilitia_03_04": "Don't worry, I'll remember.",
  "DIA_Odgar_WhoaYouAraxos_15_03": "No doubt about it. As soon as you have something, let me know.",
  "DIA_Odgar_WhoaYouAraxos_03_04": "I will, I will.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ108_Finish_15_01": "I found the traveler.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ108_Finish_03_02": "And? How much did he want for this recipe?",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ108_Finish_Dead_15_01": "Nothing, the guy was dead. One of the trolls must have thrown him off a cliff.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ108_Finish_Dead_03_02": "Damn... he didn't look like the kind of guy who'd let the first troll beat him. I think he was from this whole Nordmar, and the people there hunt orcs like game every day.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ108_Finish_Dead_15_03": "The terrain was extremely unfavorable.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ108_Finish_Dead_03_04": "Too bad about the guy. I was hoping he'd bring me something more interesting. You know what? Keep that recipe, I couldn't sit down to forge it after that.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ108_Finish_Dead_03_05": "And here's something as a reward, maybe you can try making one yourself!",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ108_Finish_Gold_15_01": "Thousand gold pieces.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ108_Finish_Gold_03_02": "Heck, he jacked up the price because he saw that I cared a lot.",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ108_Finish_Gold_15_03": "But I will keep my word. Here's your gold. I'm glad you were able to settle the matter. It'll make a fine blade!",
  "DIA_Odgar_Canyoutrainme_03_04": "Oh, and I teach my apprentices to forge weapons. If I happen to find someone skilled, he can really take a load off my shoulders in the smithy.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRAIN_Smith_15_00": "Teach me the basics of blacksmithing.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRAIN_Smith_03_01": "The most important thing is to remember about good materials. Without decent raw material you won't get anything done, so check carefully what you'll be working with.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRAIN_Smith_03_02": "Warm up the steel over the forge and hammer it on the anvil. You must give this process a lot of attention and effort, otherwise the weapon will be useless.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRAIN_Smith2_15_00": "Teach me how to forge a quality weapon.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRAIN_Smith2_03_01": "Now that you know the basics, it's time to move on to the next important point. A weapon is a tool to take life, not an ornament. When forging, think about whether it serves its purpose.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRAIN_Smith2_03_02": "Custom components such as fangs or claws, in moderate amounts, can enhance the weapon's properties, but be careful with them. As decoration, they will only get in the way.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRAIN_Smith3_15_00": "Teach me master blacksmithing techniques.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRAIN_Smith3_03_01": "There is no room for error at this level. You must stop thinking of blacksmithing as a job, from now on blacksmithing is an art for you.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRAIN_Smith3_03_02": "Every element of your weapon must be perfected. Balance, sharpness, flexibility of the blade in the case of swords, strength in the case of blunt weapons.",
  "DIA_Odgar_TRAIN_Smith3_03_03": "Inspect your weapon, look for imperfections. After gaining enough experience, you will be able to sense when a weapon breaks out of the ordinary.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Q505_Help_15_01": "Do you have some raw material to spare?",
  "DIA_Odgar_Q505_Help_03_02": "There is no such thing as too much raw material in this business. However, I think there will be something for my student.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Q505_Help_03_03": "Here, forge something nice out of it.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Ambient_15_00": "How are you doing?",
  "DIA_Odgar_Ambient_13_01": "Working on an anvil can change the most resistant person.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Ambient_13_02": "It is here, thrashing steel and grinding blades, that you learn patience and harden character.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Ambient_13_03": "The smell of burning charcoal, sparkling sparks and the music of a hammer hitting an anvil...",
  "DIA_Odgar_Ambient_13_04": "Believe me, boy. I wouldn't trade this job for anything else in the world.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Ambient_13_05": "A stranger once asked me about the secret of steel.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Ambient_13_06": "I told him: steel is steel. A piece of metal that can become a sword after a short work on an anvil.",
  "DIA_Odgar_Ambient_13_07": "But what is an ordinary sword compared to the hand that wields it?",
  "DIA_Odgar_CanTeachBestTier_03_01": "I've been thinking a bit about your work for me and how much you've already learned. I think you are now ready for me to pass on my greatest blacksmithing secrets to you.",
  "DIA_Odgar_CanTeachBestTier_03_02": "Let me know when you're ready for a longer lesson.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FinishPeon_03_01": "We've been working together a while Marvin, huh? I just remember when you came in and you could barely forge a small dagger.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FinishPeon_03_02": "And look at him now, a master blacksmith! And that's how you can call yourself from now on, a master blacksmith.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FinishPeon_03_03": "Of course, there are also a few legal quibbles, such as the fact that you can't open an establishment within the walls of Archolos for ten years after graduation.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FinishPeon_03_04": "However, the good thing is that now you can easily start studying with another master if you want to.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FinishPeon_03_05": "You were truly a great student, and may I not have many more like you, because in these ten years I would have to say goodbye to my profession!",
  "DIA_Odgar_FinalPresent_03_01": "I thought I'd have to send a runner after you! I've been sitting over my sketchbook for a long time lately, pondering the weapons you've recently provided me with.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FinalPresent_03_02": "Most weapons seem to have trouble balancing proper range, weight, and ability to do damage to the enemy regardless of armor.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FinalPresent_03_03": "Then I came up with THIS. Nothing more to say here, take this recipe, march to the anvil and see what you can get away with with this weapon.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FinalPresent_03_04": "Consider it a gift as part of our long-term relationship.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_07_10": "And bring shame upon myself? The whole Artisans' District would laugh at me in the tavern tomorrow if they found out I was forging weapons for my apprentice.",
  "DIA_Odgar_FMQ002_07_11": "Here's the recipe, get the ingredients yourself and forge a sword that you can show off to both Roderich and myself with!",
  "DIA_Odgar_PQ102_Smither_15_01": "I know blacksmithing, isn't that enough?",
