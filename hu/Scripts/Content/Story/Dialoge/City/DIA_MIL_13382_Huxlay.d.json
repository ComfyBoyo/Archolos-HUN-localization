  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Grayson_03_02": "Very difficult. Too bad your little provocation failed.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Grayson_03_03": "You didn't do a very good job of gaining Unicorn's trust either.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Grayson_15_04": "I did the best I could.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Grayson_03_05": "And it wasn't enough, that's the only reason you're talking to me.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Help_Description": "Apparently you have your own ways of getting what Grayson wants. You know the case?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Help_15_01": "Apparently you have your own ways of getting what Grayson wants. You know the case?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Help_03_02": "I know. His Excellency introduced me to the subject with Euric.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Help_03_03": "Before we begin, let me make something clear. I know you can't afford to mess up this assignment.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Help_03_04": "Therefore, know that you will not like what I do. If you start questioning my methods, our partnership ends.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Help_03_05": "I'll finish this on my own.",

  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_03_02": "Nothing. Stay out of my way.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_15_03": "Grayson said...",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_03_04": "Don't do anything for now. If you stay out of the way, I'll tell him you've been very helpful.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_Next_03_01": "Come to the Dark Mysteries at midnight tonight. Tell that I'm expecting you. Got it?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_Next_15_02": "Midnight. Dark Mysteries. Roger",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_Next_03_03": "I'll see you tonight, kid.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_No_15_01": "I don't think he'll be happy.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_No_03_02": "I'll let you off the hook this time. What did I say about questioning my decisions?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_No_15_03": "I didn't say anything.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_Yes_15_01": "You're in charge.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_WhatDo_Yes_03_02": "You caught on fast.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finally_03_01": "I was afraid you wouldn't show up.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finally_15_02": "I try to keep my word.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finally_03_03": "A valuable thing - though not in my profession.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finally_Who_15_01": "Who are we having fun with?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finally_Who_03_02": "Where are my manners. Meet Flex - active musician of the group In Extremo!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finally_Who_03_03": "Flex, say hello!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finally_Who_03_04": "Oho, he must have lost consciousness!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finally_Who_03_05": "All right, Marvin. Time to show you what life is really like. Take that bottle of water and pour it on him. That should wake him up.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_What_15_01": "What did you do to him?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_What_03_02": "Nothing yet. I haven't even warmed up. Now that our friend has regained consciousness, we can begin!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_BeatHim_03_01": "Flex! I think you know why you're here. The sooner you admit it, the sooner we can end this lovely meeting of ours.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_BeatHim_03_02": "Admit it? To what? I'm innocent! Who are you?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_BeatHim_03_03": "A concerned citizen. I could not allow you and your friends to openly incite rebellion against the King!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_BeatHim_03_04": "What rebellion? I don't know what you're talking about, man!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_BeatHim_03_05": "I warned you. Kid, punch him in the face. He'll remember what we're talking about here.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_BeatHim_No_15_01": "It's enough that I have to look at it",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_BeatHim_No_03_02": "Are you questioning my instructions?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_BeatHim_No_15_03": "No. I'm not getting in your way - like you asked.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_BeatHim_No_03_04": "In that case, I'll do it myself.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_BeatHim_Yes_15_01": "With pleasure!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_03_01": "Do you remember now?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_03_02": "My face.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_03_03": "Let me refresh your memory.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_03_04": "You and your buddies, In Extremo, are inciting people to revolt.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_03_05": "What revolt!? We criticize his new ordinance! People are being taken captive in the colony for nothing!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_03_06": "So you admit it?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_03_07": "I'm not admitting anything! I'm telling the truth!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_03_08": "You heard it yourself, kid! He doesn't seem to understand what he's doing.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_03_09": "You have to explain it to him... Do you want to help me?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_No_03_01": "Well, as the classic used to say, 'I don't want to, but I have to.'",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_AfterBeatUp_Yes_15_01": "If I have to...",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_03_01": "Don't hit me anymore. Please don't.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_03_02": "I already told you. How long it lasts is entirely up to you.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_03_03": "I will ask the question again. Do you admit to trying to incite rebellion on Archolos?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_03_04": "No. I'm innocent!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_03_05": "You disappoint me. Well... we need to move on to more convincing arguments.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_03_06": "Do you feel the heat? You wouldn't want that rod to meet your skin, would you?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_03_07": "Please, don't! Don't do it, I beg you!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_03_08": "Oh, I think my hand's about to slip. Oh, no!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_Action_15_01": "That's enough. He can't stand the pain.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_Action_03_02": "I understand you're an expert in this field. I told you...",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_Action_15_03": "Let me talk to him in private. Five minutes.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_Action_03_04": "You hear that, Flex? My friend wants me to leave. All right, I'll leave you guys for a while.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_Action_03_05": "I promise to be back soon.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finish_03_01": "Now tell me, who conspired?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finish_03_02": "I, Flex, have conspired against the King!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finish_03_03": "And anyone else?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finish_03_04": "I... and the whole In Extremo group.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finish_03_05": "I want your statement in writing. Do you think he can do it?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finish_03_06": "Give me a moment and then I will do as you request.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finish_03_07": "All right, kid. We got what we wanted. I'll take care of the rest.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Finish_03_08": "Give my compliments to His Excellency.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_Nothing_03_01": "Warmer... warmer... hot!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_Nothing_03_02": "I confess! I confess! Don't hurt me anymore!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_HaveMercy_Nothing_03_03": "Couldn't you have done it right away?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Result_03_01": "So, kid, what'd you figure out?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Result_15_02": "Flex pleaded guilty.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Result_03_03": "What's that? Am I hearing right? Flex, is that right?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ404_Result_03_04": "I confess!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_15_01": "We meet again.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_03_02": "Marvin! How good it is that we get to work together again!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_15_03": "Grayson sent me.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_03_04": "I know. I heard about you.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_03_05": "Too bad you decided to tackle the In Extremo matter by yourself. I was hoping I could have some fun at work for once.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_03_06": "Listen carefully. The case is very complicated, but I've managed to find out a few things. The most important thing is not to draw attention to yourself.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_03_07": "The head of the shipyard is Dack, immediately followed by his son, Foral. Both are clean - they have nothing to do with the delays at the shipyard.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_Why_15_01": "What makes you so sure?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_Why_03_02": "Dack himself went to Morris asking for help because he didn't understand who was delaying the work and how. The guards, as guards do, poked around, asked questions and found nothing.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_Why_03_03": "Foral, on the other hand, prefers to sit with Ulryk's men. It is impossible for him to be behind this - he would simply run out of time.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_Why_03_04": "Whatever you do, stay away from these two.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_Why_15_05": "You said yourself that they care about solving the case.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Hello_Why_03_06": "Yes, but if they find out we're looking for a saboteur, they'll panic, and then the saboteur will slip up on us as soon as things get hot.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_What_15_01": "So what do we do?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_What_03_02": "I have an idea, but you won't like it very much.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_What_03_03": "Blend in with the crowd. Here's your work outfit. Pretend you're working there. If you want to catch a criminal, you have to think like a criminal.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_What_03_04": "You will become a saboteur yourself. Then whoever is behind it will reveal himself. Either he'll be disturbed by the competition, or he'll offer you to cooperate.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_What_03_05": "Trust me, I sat in a similar business myself for many years.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_What_03_06": "Here's a list of things that need to be done. It's not worth talking about out loud.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_What_15_07": "Wait! What about Anskar?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_What_03_08": "I have a lead, but I can't take you with me. My underworld contacts don't like strangers.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_What_03_09": "Take care of this case, then we'll worry about it. When you're done, meet me at the same place.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_15_01": "Let's talk about the shipyard...",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_03_02": "How did it go?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_15_03": "There is no saboteur.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_03_04": "What?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_15_05": "The shipyard is mismanaged. Dack and his son are completely failing at policing the workers.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_15_06": "I've seen with my own eyes how they go around. Literally no one works there like they should.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_03_07": "I didn't see that coming.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_15_08": "There's no point in going back to Grayson with this information. He expects us to solve the problem.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_03_09": "Hmm, what if you got someone in there who knows how to motivate employees to work?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_03_10": "Do you know Knut?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_15_11": "The boss of the woodcutters. Of course I know him!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_03_12": "Then you know what a demanding man he is.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_15_13": "That name doesn't mean anything to me.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_03_14": "Knut is the boss of the woodcutters. They work by the Wolf Den. He's a strict and demanding man. He'll be perfect.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_15_15": "Do you think he'll be convinced?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_03_16": "If you don't try, you won't know. Talk to him. I'll go to Grayson so he can expect his visit. I'm sure they'll want to set financial terms.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Harbour_03_17": "Then we'll meet back here. I remind you that we have the second part of the task ahead of us. I'll let you in on everything later.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ407_Wait_03_01": "Well, you're finally here. Everyone's waiting for you and Oliver.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ407_Wait_15_02": "We're not done with that orc yet.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ407_Wait_03_03": "Then what are you doing here? Make it quick. Time's running out.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ407_Wait_15_04": "Oliver is dead. He was foolish enough to want to talk to the orc face to face.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ407_Wait_03_05": "What a joke of a great scientist! All right, come on in. We need to get started.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Okay_15_01": "Are you all right?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Okay_03_02": "I let myself be duped like a child!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Okay_03_03": "I worked with that scumbag for many years! I didn't expect him to betray me!",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Okay_03_04": "Good work, Marvin. Let's get the Admiral to Grayson.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Okay_15_05": "You want me to overlook the fact that you got caught?",
  "DIA_Huxlay_KQ406_Okay_03_06": "No. Tell the truth. Always. He'll eventually find out you're up to something.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_Hello_03_01": "Like all Guardsmen, I make sure the Royal Envoy is safe. I hope you won't interfere with that.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_Ambient_03_01": "Do something useful instead of soliciting busy people.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_Ambient_03_02": "After dealing with In Extremo, one problem has been solved, but there's a lot we still have to deal with.",
  "DIA_Huxlay_Ambient_03_03": "Not bad at all with me, especially with the knowledge that there are people on this island as successful as you."
