  "DIA_Citizen_SQ207_Hello_03_03": "I made an appointment with her today. She was going to give me a small set of hammers... And also this... Innos figurine.",
  "DIA_Citizen_SQ207_Hello_03_04": "Give me those things because I have to get back to my daughter.",
  "DIA_Citizen_SQ207_Hello_15_06": "I don't know anything about that. I'll check to see if these things are here at all.",
  "DIA_Citizen_SQ207_Hello_03_07": "Don't look! I know where she keeps these things. In that chest. I'll take it and I'll be gone.",
  "DIA_Citizen_SQ207_Hello_15_08": "Relax, I'll do it myself.",
  "DIA_Citizen_SQ207_Items_15_01": "Indeed. These items are here.",

  "DIA_Citizen_SQ207_Items_No_15_03": "Perhaps, you can wait for her and explain the matter.",
  "DIA_Citizen_SQ207_Items_No_03_04": "I have a daughter! Alone in the house! Come on, don't waste my time!",
  "DIA_Citizen_SQ207_Items_No_15_05": "Congratulations, but I will not release the items without Dima's explicit instruction.",
  "DIA_Citizen_SQ207_Items_No_03_06": "Oh, no! I won't let you treat me like this! You don't work here anymore! I guarantee it. Dima will find out!"
