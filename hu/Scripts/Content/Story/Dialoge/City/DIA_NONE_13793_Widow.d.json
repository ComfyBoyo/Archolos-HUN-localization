  "DIA_Widow_NS60_Story_03_03": "Once upon a time, my husband and I had a small shop.",
  "DIA_Widow_NS60_Story_03_04": "We could not complain about the lack of clients. Sometimes it was not easy but we were happy.",
  "DIA_Widow_NS60_Story_03_05": "And then he got that cursed letter with the king's seal!",
  "DIA_Widow_NS60_Story2_15_01": "Let me guess... He was sent to the front?",

  "DIA_Widow_NS60_Story3_03_04": "And now here I am - on the street. I beg anyone for any help!",
  "DIA_Widow_NS60_NoGold_15_01": "Sorry, I don't have any gold on me.",
  "DIA_Widow_NS60_NoGold_03_02": "It's a matter of life and death for me! I'm sure someone else will take pity...",
