  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_03_02": "I help my master, Susanne. One day I would like to make jewelry as well as she does, but I still have a lot to learn.",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_03_06": "If I were you, I wouldn't flaunt where you're from.",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Threat_15_01": "Are you saying I'm in danger?",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Threat_03_02": "How shall I put it...",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Threat_03_03": "Not everyone here is fond of strangers.",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Threat_03_04": "It's still not that bad in the city, but in the countryside people can be really unpleasant.",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Threat_15_05": "Yeah... I've had time to figure it out.",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Sorry_15_01": "I'm sorry.",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Sorry_03_02": "It's been a year since those events, and I still can't get over them.",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Sorry_03_03": "For your own good, stay away from dim alleyways - especially after dark!",

  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Weak_15_01": "He was probably a weakling.",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Weak_03_02": "A weakling? Is that what you would call someone who could move several dozen barrels full of wine a day?",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Weak_15_03": "Somehow his... strength didn't save him.",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Weak_03_04": "It didn't save him because he was attacked by a bunch of bloody cowards - that's what!",
  "DIA_Adrien_CanTrade_15_01": "Susanne said you were selling your wares.",
  "DIA_Adrien_CanTrade_03_02": "That's right. I sell silver and gold jewelry, but there will be some rare items as well.",
  "DIA_Adrien_TRADE_15_01": "Show me your goods.",
  "DIA_Adrien_TRADE_03_02": "Rings, necklaces and amulets. Take your pick.",
  "DIA_Adrien_TRADE_03_03": "All our products are of high quality.",
  "DIA_Adrien_TRADE_03_04": "Choose whatever you like.",
  "DIA_Adrien_Ambient_15_01": "What's going on in the world of goldsmiths?",
  "DIA_Adrien_Ambient_03_06": "Susanne is a woman with ironclad principles, but she has a true heart of gold.",
  "DIA_Adrien_Ambient_03_07": "If it weren't for her, I'd still be scrubbing latrines in the Siren's Wail.",
  "DIA_Adrien_HELLO_Threat_Choice": "Are you saying I'm in danger?"
