  "DIA_Nathaniel_Who_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Who_03_02": "My name is Nathaniel and I am a merchant.",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Who_03_04": "I can't afford to pay my dues. I work alone.",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Who_15_05": "What are you trading here?",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Who_03_06": "Nothing at the moment, because my purse is a little empty. I'm trying to find something and I'm tidying up my stash.",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_House_15_01": "You got a big house for a poor man.",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_House_03_02": "Home?",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_House_15_03": "The one you live in.",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_House_03_04": "Oh, right... Sorry... I'm a little distracted today.",

  "DIA_Nathaniel_Blake_Osip_15_03": "That's right.",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Blake_Osip_03_04": "Blake... Blake... yeah... I'm starting to remember now.",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Blake_Osip_03_05": "Follow me. I think I know where you can find him.",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Blake_Osip_03_06": "I invite you upstairs.",

  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_15_03": "What do you keep in there?",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_03_04": "Nothing special. Mostly stuff from the previous owner.",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_03_05": "It's a terrible mess and... it's full of huge rats. Really, you wouldn't want to go in there!",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_Open_15_01": "Could you open the bars, please?",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_Open_03_02": "The problem is... the lock got jammed, and since then, it hasn't moved.",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_Open_03_03": "Why don't you... take another look at the ground floor? Just to make sure you didn't miss something?",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_Open_15_04": "Then what does this lever open?",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_Open_03_05": "The lever...? What lever?",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_Open_03_06": "I have no idea... in truth, this is the first time I've seen it!",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_Open_15_07": "Why don't you pull it, then we'll see what happens?",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_Open_03_08": "Actually, I could, but...",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_Open_15_09": "But?",
  "DIA_Nathaniel_Crates_Open_03_10": "But I have a much better idea.",
