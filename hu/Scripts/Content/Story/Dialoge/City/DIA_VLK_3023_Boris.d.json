{
  "DIA_Boris_Hello_03_01": "Hello, my name is Frida. If you need skins or ranged weapons, you've come to the right place.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowTrade_15_01": "How did you get into trading?",
  "DIA_Boris_HowTrade_03_02": "I learned everything from my husband. I worked alongside him until the King called him into service.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowTrade_03_03": "So I decided to take care of it myself, in his absence. After all, it's better to leave the business to your wife than to someone else.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowTrade_03_04": "It was hard at first, but over the years I've picked up on his methods so I wasn't completely green at it.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowTrade_03_05": "I only know the basics of hunting myself, so I had to offer friendly hunters better prices for their services, leaving myself to trade only.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowTrade_03_06": "After a while, I outlasted the merchants who had previously ripped me off.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowTrade_15_07": "So you need to be well versed in the trade.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowTrade_03_08": "I owe my success to good deals with my hunter friends and being honest.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowTrade_03_09": "Customers appreciate good quality at a good price, and suppliers appreciate the fact that I don't cheat them.",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Start_15_01": "Do you have a job for me?",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Start_15_02": "I need a reference to become a citizen, maybe you could give me one in exchange for honest work?",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Start_03_04": "Can you hunt?",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Start_15_07": "I learned something about it.",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Start_03_08": "That's great. I've had a lot of orders lately and Allan can't keep up with the skin delivery.",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Start_03_09": "If you go to him and help him with his work, I will gladly reward you.",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Start_15_05": "Unfortunately, no.",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Start_03_06": "I'm sorry, in that case I don't have a job for you.",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Finish_15_01": "I was at Allan's.",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Finish_03_02": "I hear you managed to hunt more than just wolves. You took down a bear! Damn, you should take up that trade, you've got a knack for it.",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Finish_03_03": "I have few gold coins for you.",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Finish_15_04": "I would prefer a reference to becoming a citizen.",
  "DIA_Boris_CQ002_Finish_03_05": "There you go.",
  "DIA_Boris_ReferenceExchange_Description": "Could I exchange my reward for a reference? (100 GP)",
  "DIA_Boris_ReferenceExchange_15_01": "Could I trade my reward for a reference?",
  "DIA_Boris_ReferenceExchange_03_02": "No problem. Give me a minute, I'll write you one.",
  "DIA_Boris_ReferenceExchange_03_03": "Here. Good luck getting the paperwork done with Matey.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Start_15_01": "Aren't you looking for an employee?",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Start_03_02": "Even if I'm looking, you'd have to prove to me that you're up to something.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Start_03_03": "The hunt with Allan went well for you, the demand for skins is high as people stock up for the winter...",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Start_03_04": "Not the worst idea, but one step at a time.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Start_03_05": "Let's start with the fact that you're already an apprentice to another master, so I won't take you on as my own. At most, I'll commission a single job.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Start_03_06": "The most sensible option would be for you to become my apprentice. We'd both have a steady source of income.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Start_03_07": "In this line of work, it's important to be able to follow instructions efficiently, and I don't know if you can do that. And I'd need to see written proof that you have citizenship.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Start_03_08": "I don't know what has gone on in the minds of these bureaucrats. You used to have to have a job to become a citizen, now it's the exact opposite!",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_15_01": "Here, my citizenship document.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_02": "Let's see...",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_03": "Well, now we can talk!",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_04": "I heard you gave Alice a shove by opening the cage with that screamer of hers.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_05": "I've always wanted to... never mind. You made it even better!",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_15_06": "I think you have me confused with someone, it wasn't me.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_07": "Oh, don't be so modest. News travels fast.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_08": "People say that the enemies of my enemies are my friends. Therefore, if you wish to become my apprentice, I will gladly accept you.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_09": "And it's nice to pay someone who handles real problems so efficiently. There you go, your payment.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_10": "As I said, your ability to follow orders needs to be tested. What I say now must remain between us.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_15_11": "No problem, I'll be discreet.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_12": "Listen, there's a saleswoman in town named Alice. Smart broad, I don't like her. She keeps a harpy locked in a cage in her shop.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_13": "I don't know if it's legal, anyway, the guards say that as long as the 'bird' doesn't cause any danger, they won't intervene.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_15_14": "Am I supposed to cause a problem?",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Beginning_03_15": "You're a smart boy. I think if the cage had opened in broad daylight, the guard will have to finally do something.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_YouCare_15_01": "Why do you care so much?",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_YouCare_03_02": "Every hunter respects the game he hunts to some degree. Harpies are made to fly, not to rot in a cage!",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_How_15_01": "How do I open it?",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_How_03_02": "Preferably so Alice doesn't catch you, though it's not a must. As far as I know, the button to open the cage door is behind her counter.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_How_03_03": "I'm sure you can find a way to press it.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Why_15_01": "Why don't you like Alice?",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_Why_03_02": "Let's just say we have a troubled past. You don't need to know.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_JobDone_03_00": "I hear you were able to complete the assignment. Congratulations.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_JobDone_15_01": "You've heard about this already?",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_JobDone_03_02": "Man, that was quite a commotion. I could hear the screams here. I just hope nobody got hurt too badly...",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_JobDone_03_03": "But never mind that. The important thing is that you've confirmed your usefulness.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_JobDone_03_04": "And it's nice to pay someone who handles real problems so efficiently. There you go, your payment.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ106_JobDone_03_05": "If you want to become my apprentice, no problem, we can do the paperwork.",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeon_15_01": "I want to be your apprentice.",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeon_03_02": "Very good! They won't give you a better job in town, remember.",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeon_03_03": "Do you realize that you can only be an apprentice to one master?",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeon_15_04": "I heard something about it...",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeon_03_05": "Until I think you know enough, you work only for me. So? Decided?",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeonNotSure_15_01": "I'll think about it some more.",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeonNotSure_03_02": "What do you want to think about? I don't understand, but okay, sleep on it.",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeonYes_15_01": "Sure, I'm in.",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeonYes_03_06": "Apparently you're involved in some kind of crime.",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeonYes_03_07": "Come back when you have settled this matter with the guard commander.",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeonYes_03_02": "There's one more thing. Can you skin an animal?",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeonYes_15_03": "Not really...",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeonYes_03_04": "Then what use will you be to me? Although... you know, I could teach you that. For a small fee, of course.",
  "DIA_Boris_IwanttobePeonYes_03_05": "This is the best decision you've made in your life!",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_15_04": "I was expecting something more fascinating.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_05": "More? Thank the gods!",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_06": "I just happen to have a serious problem. That damn wench, Alice, she... she got her hands on the deed to my store!",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_07": "Damn thief! She won't give it back to me, or even resell it! I was hoping that because of the harpy problems she would relent, but no.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_15_08": "Truly, an interesting way to negotiate...",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_03_09": "Don't pick on me. Anyway, since I couldn't do it, someone else has to get the document back. You've got to do something, or I'll be out on the street!",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeon_SideQuest_15_10": "I'll see what I can do.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeon_15_00": "What am I supposed to do?",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeon_03_01": "I have Allan for sitting on his rump and tanning leather. You're young, so you're probably just going anywhere. So you can get some beast skins along the way.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeon_03_02": "I'll pay you more for them than anyone on the island, after all, no one but me understands so well how serious hunting is.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeonGuide_03_01": "Bring me skins of any beast you can find. I'll pay you better for them than any of my other associates.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeonGuide_03_02": "Just don't bring me any other trophies, horns, teeth and that kind of things don't interest me.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeonGuide_03_03": "If you want, I can teach you how to make bows, too. I will gladly pay you for each piece, just bring me different ones.",
  "DIA_Boris_HowToBePeonGuide_03_04": "By bringing me the same ones over and over, the market will get saturated and eventually they will stop selling.",
  "DIA_Boris_WhoaYouMilitia_03_01": "A guard, huh? You like to keep order?",
  "DIA_Boris_WhoaYouMilitia_03_02": "Look, I know that with your pay you probably don't have to work for me as much anymore, but I'm always happy to buy something back from you, remember that.",
  "DIA_Boris_WhoaYouAraxos_03_01": "Damn, they don't take just anybody to Araxos. You must have impressed them!",
  "DIA_Boris_WhoaYouAraxos_03_02": "I know you are looking for all kinds of ways to make money, so my offer to pay for skins and bows still stands.",
  "DIA_Boris_WhoaYouAraxos_15_03": "I hope you'll have something more interesting for me to do than simply fetch skins.",
  "DIA_Boris_WhoaYouAraxos_03_04": "Sure, I'll think about it. Come back in a while, you'll get something.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ107_Starting_03_01": "Marvin, remember when I told you I had something for you? Well, here it is.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Lexx_15_01": "Luna would like her money back.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Lexx_03_02": "In that case, my crossbow is gone...",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Lexx_15_03": "How is it possible for a master artisan to be penniless?",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Lexx_03_04": "Business is going well. It's just a shame that all my income goes to 'protect my business'.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_15_01": "What are you talking about?",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_03_02": "Some of Volker's men visit me regularly. They're not aggressive, but I'm afraid a refusal could end badly for me.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_15_03": "Afraid of a couple of thugs?",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_03_04": "I'm afraid of Volker. He's an influential man - I don't want to have to deal with him.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_Know_15_01": "Do you think he knows about the whole thing?",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_Know_03_02": "He knows, or he's turning a blind eye. Either way, if this keeps up, I can pack my bags.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_Know_15_03": "What do these thugs look like?",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_Know_03_04": "Volker's men wear distinctive armor - but you've probably noticed that yourself.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_Know_03_05": "However, the group that regularly 'visits' me is led by a guy with a scar on his cheek. Apparently they usually gather at Volker's house.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_Know_15_06": "Someone should do something about them...",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_Know_03_07": "Man, forget it, you can't handle them! Mr. Volker invests in training his people.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_What_Know_03_08": "Tell Luna I'm sorry and stay out of it. It'll be more trouble than good.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_03_09": "I cannot leave the shop now, but tell Luna that as soon as my duties permit me, we will settle matters between us.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_15_01": "You don't have to worry about Volker's people anymore.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_03_02": "Did you manage to get it done?",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_15_03": "My arguments convinced that thug to leave you alone.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_03_04": "You beat him?! I'm impressed!",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_03_05": "I just hope I don't get in trouble with Bradlock over this...",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_15_06": "I spoke to Bradlock. In short, he wasn't happy with his man's behavior.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_15_07": "He told me to give you this letter and promised to personally deal with the thugs.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_03_08": "Thank you for taking care of this matter, I was already afraid that this scoundrel would not give me peace.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_Give_15_01": "Bradlock also told me to give you this pouch. It's for the recent inconvenience.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_Give_03_02": "That's very nice of him. There aren't many honest people these days.",
  "DIA_Boris_Teach_15_01": "Could you teach me something?",
  "DIA_Boris_Teach_03_02": "Of course. As I want to sell the weapons you supply for the best possible money, they must be of the highest quality.",
  "DIA_Boris_Teach_03_03": "So I'm going to show you some bowmaking tricks that will allow you to produce something more than sticks tied with string. Just make good use of this knowledge!",
  "DIA_Boris_TeachFletchery_15_01": "Teach me basic bowmaking techniques.",
  "DIA_Boris_TeachFletchery_13_02": "When you start working on a bow or crossbow, you need to look carefully at the materials you use. The wood needs to be pliable but also strong, which is best checked as you go along.",
  "DIA_Boris_TeachFletchery_13_03": "Ideally, you should train yourself in shooting them. Then you'll be able to skillfully inspect how much the weapon you produce is worth.",
  "DIA_Boris_TeachFletchery2_15_01": "Teach me better bowmaking techniques.",
  "DIA_Boris_TeachFletchery2_13_02": "Does the term 'composite' mean anything to you? If not, it's high time to get interested in it. It's about combining several materials together to achieve optimum flexibility and strength of the bow.",
  "DIA_Boris_TeachFletchery2_13_03": "Really high quality weapons are made by using not only wood, but also animal horns or claws in the process. Learn how to obtain them, and your creations will gain in quality.",
  "DIA_Boris_TeachFletchery3_15_01": "Teach me master bowmaking techniques.",
  "DIA_Boris_TeachFletchery3_13_02": "A master bowyer differs from adepts in only one thing - he never uses half-measures. Don't like the riser? Start working from scratch. Limbs bend badly? Start working from scratch.",
  "DIA_Boris_TeachFletchery3_13_03": "With low to medium quality weapons, you could allow for minor imperfections, a not skilled archer wouldn't notice them anyway. Now you will be making weapons for people who notice everything.",
  "DIA_Boris_TeachFletchery3_13_04": "So before you bring me anything, carefully check that it meets all the requirements. I will not pay you if I find even a small flaw, for these are the very things that sometimes determine life and death.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ107_Ending_15_01": "I have your property deed.",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ107_Ending_03_02": "Really? Show me!",
  "DIA_Boris_PQ107_Ending_03_03": "Great! Now Alice can at most bite me and not take over the shop! You did a great job, here's your well-deserved reward.",
  "DIA_Boris_Q505_Help_Description": "I'm going to check out dangerous ruins...",
  "DIA_Boris_Q505_Help_15_01": "I'm going to check out dangerous ruins, don't you have anything that could help me there?",
  "DIA_Boris_Q505_Help_03_02": "Ruins, you say? I can give you some hides, even if you don't make anything out of them, at least you can keep warm with them.",
  "DIA_Boris_Q505_Help_03_03": "Please consider this a reward for our past cooperation.",
  "DIA_Boris_AllanIsDead_15_01": "Allan is dead.",
  "DIA_Boris_AllanIsDead_03_02": "What's that? Are you sure?",
  "DIA_Boris_AllanIsDead_15_03": "I'm very sorry, I saw his corpse in the forest.",
  "DIA_Boris_AllanIsDead_03_04": "What a tragedy... Pity about the boy. I won't find a conscientious hunter like him again...",
  "DIA_Boris_FinishPeon_03_01": "I've been thinking a bit about our partnership and I think the time has come. I officially announce that you have completed your apprenticeship and as of today you can title yourself as a master bowyer.",
  "DIA_Boris_FinishPeon_03_02": "You have proven that you know the craft and are willing to spend a lot of time perfecting the art of bowmaking.",
  "DIA_Boris_FinishPeon_03_03": "Keep working like that and maybe in a few years, and a few dozen hunted shadowbeasts, you'll make a property like Detlow himself!",
  "DIA_Boris_FinishPeon_03_04": "Now feel free to start working with another master, but I won't complain if you provide me with some trophies or weapons from time to time!",
  "DIA_Boris_FinalPresent_03_01": "Good to see you, Marvin. I have something you'll like!",
  "DIA_Boris_FinalPresent_03_02": "Some time ago, I got my hands on a very old bow. At first I thought of using it as a wall decoration, but something made me shoot a few arrows from it.",
  "DIA_Boris_FinalPresent_03_03": "The years of course took their toll on it and it almost fell apart in my hands, but it gave me the idea to improve the string tensioning mechanism.",
  "DIA_Boris_FinalPresent_03_04": "What's more, it can be used in both bows and crossbows! Take this diagram, gather the materials and try this wonder. You won't be disappointed!",
  "DIA_Borris_Hunting_Base_15_01": "Teach me the basics of obtaining animal trophies.",
  "DIA_Borris_Hunting_Base_03_02": "The basics generally include pulling the skins off furry animals. They're relatively delicate, and as a result, they're easy to pull off.",
  "DIA_Borris_Hunting_Base_03_03": "When you feel a particularly sensitive spot on the body of a hunted game, cut it with something sharp, and gradually begin to pull off all the skin.",
  "DIA_Borris_Hunting_Base_03_04": "In the process, be careful that it doesn't accidentally tear. It will lose value then, and you don't want that.",
  "DIA_Borris_Hunting_Base_03_05": "Like I said, for a small fee, but not that small!",
  "DIA_Borris_Base_Sneak_03_01": "If you're going to go for it, you probably know how to properly approach your game. Maybe I'll remind you just in case.",
  "DIA_Borris_Base_Sneak_03_02": "Move on bent legs, discreetly, quietly, carefully taking each step. Okay, now I can move on with a clear conscience.",
  "DIA_Boris_Trade_AnimalSkin_15_01": "I have some skins for sale.",
  "DIA_Boris_Trade_AnimalSkin_03_02": "That's what I expect from you. Show them.",
  "DIA_Boris_Trade_AnimalSkin_03_03": "Well, let's see what you got.",
  "DIA_Boris_Trade_AnimalSkin_03_07": "What are you bothering me for?",
  "DIA_Boris_Trade_AnimalSkin_03_08": "Well, it's always something.",
  "DIA_Boris_Trade_AnimalSkin_03_09": "If everyone brought me this much, I would have been rich a long time ago!",
  "DIA_Boris_CanIToo_15_01": "Would you buy trophies from me too?",
  "DIA_Boris_CanIToo_03_02": "Of course, provided that they are high quality skins. I'll pay you more for them than others on the market, it will definitely be worth it.",
  "DIA_Boris_IHaveWeapon_03_02": "Great, show what you created.",
  "DIA_Boris_IHaveWeapon_03_03": "Beautiful piece.",
  "DIA_Boris_IHaveWeapon_03_04": "Masterful work.",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_Keep_Choice": "(Keep the pouch from Bradlock)",
  "DIA_Boris_SQ207_Result_Give_Choice": "(Give the pouch from Bradlock)",
  "DIA_Boris_Trade_AnimalSkin_Special_Choice": "Curios.",
  "DIA_Boris_Trade_AnimalSkin_Reptiles_Choice": "Reptiles.",
  "DIA_Boris_Trade_AnimalSkin_Mammals_Choice": "Mammals.",
  "DIA_Boris_IHaveWeapon_Crossbow_Choice": "Crossbows.",
  "DIA_Boris_IHaveWeapon_Bow_Choice": "Bows."
