{
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_Next_03_01": "That's all. We'd better not keep her waiting at the very start of our partnership. Go, and show what the Guild is capable of!",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_15_01": "I'm here for an assignment.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_03_02": "What is this, a rookie trying to show he's up to something? Okay, I got something for you.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_03_03": "You've been in the Guild for a while now and you want to make some money, huh? Okay.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_03_04": "When my trackers are doing fieldwork, they happen to collect a lot of different plants. Most of them we simply sell to alchemists, because what else are we going to do with them?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_03_05": "However, we need a steady supply of potions, be it healing or somehow enhancing the guys' skills. That's why we want to partner with Ramha.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_03_06": "No one in town makes better elixirs than her. We talked to her about it, and she said she'd agree to sign the contract, but we need to help her with some escapade.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_What_15_01": "What kind of escapade?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_What_03_02": "I don't know, you'll have to ask her. Given her expertise, and the way she expressed herself, you'll have to go somewhere outside the city.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_Help_15_01": "That help is the only condition?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_Help_03_02": "The only one she's talked about so far. I hope she doesn't come up with something new, because we're not going to beg anyone to work with us.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_Help_03_03": "Just in case, follow her instructions so that she has no doubt about the quality of our service.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_Hurt_15_01": "What if something happens to her?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Start_Hurt_03_02": "It better not, and if it does, it can't be your fault. Araxos must have clean hands.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Where_15_01": "Where can I find Ramha?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Where_03_02": "She has her workshop in the Artisan's District, somewhere just off the harbor exit.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_15_01": "Ramha will sign a contract with us.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_03_02": "I know, I heard, we're already working on it. Good job, kid. I hear it got heated during the action.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_15_03": "A little bit, yeah. We almost got eaten by animals.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_03_04": "Well, that's the job of Araxos trackers. Get used to it if you want to join us!",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_03_05": "Where do I... ah, here it is, your payment.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_03_06": "What have you done!",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_03_07": "How do you expect to sign a contract with someone you left for dead?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_15_08": "Is this about Ramha?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_03_09": "Yes, damn it! The barber-surgeon was worried because you hadn't been back for a long time, so he went to see what it was all about and found her unconscious!",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_03_10": "Why didn't you get help?! Eh, whatever, don't say anything. I already told her you were young, inexperienced, and panicked.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA202_Finish_03_11": "If she hadn't been impressed by your fight with the animals, there probably would have been nothing of the contract, and so at least we managed to get it done, albeit on flimsy terms.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Next_03_01": "I think that's enough information for you. Get to work.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_15_01": "Is there a job specifically for a tracker?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_03_02": "There's always work for trackers. Let's see what I can assign you...",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_03_03": "That would be appropriate. Someone needs to check the area through which our associate Ernesto will be walking to the Great Vineyard.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_03_04": "You know the area, don't you? That's right. Any questions?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Why_15_01": "Why does he go to the Great Vineyard?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Why_03_02": "Well, why would a merchant go anywhere? He has some business to do there, I don't know what, and I forbid you to ask him for details.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Why_03_03": "People value our services precisely because of the discretion and lack of additional questions. Do you understand?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Why_15_04": "Of course.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Many_15_01": "There are several roads leading to the Great Vineyard...",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Many_03_02": "We are interested in two, as Ernesto has not yet decided which one he will choose.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Many_03_03": "The first is the old tunnel up the hill opposite the city. Not the collapsed one, of course, but the one that leads into the woods behind the Great Vineyard.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Many_03_04": "The other is a path through a ruined ravine. You know, the one where the fallen rocks are held up by a few beams.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Who_15_01": "Do I get anyone to help me?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Start_Who_03_02": "Come on, we only send more people on the tough jobs!",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Question_15_01": "I hear you want me in your unit.",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Question_03_02": "It's possible. There's only room for the best among the trackers of Araxos, and you've proven your worth. What do you think of that?",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Ready_15_01": "I'm ready to join your unit.",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Ready_03_02": "Well, well, you know some stuff! I'm happy to put you in the tracker unit. You'll see, you won't regret it!",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Ready_03_03": "From now on, my orders are more important to you than Adelard's. As a tracker, you must show all the hunters on the island who's boss!",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Ready_03_04": "Your assignments will now become more dangerous, but also much better paid. To help you accomplish them, you will be given access to the best equipment and teachers.",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Ready_03_05": "Just remember, if you let me down, you'll end up with not one, but two arrows in your knee.",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Ready_15_06": "In that case, my knee will be fine because I'm not used to failing.",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Ready_03_07": "And that's what I wanted to hear. Go to Ingor now, he'll have new equipment for you. You'll finally learn what it means to wear decent armor!",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Ready_03_08": "How did you do so well on the mission? I'm sorry, but shooting skills are paramount for an Araxos tracker.",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier1_Ready_03_09": "Come back when you've gained some practice.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_15_01": "I checked both ways.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_15_02": "I found a bear and a couple of rats near the tunnel. I got rid of all of them so the passage is safe.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_15_03": "I'm more concerned about the passage in the collapsed ravine. I found some unusual items there.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_15_04": "A rope tied to one of the beams, oddly placed stones in the bushes, two shields and a clearly marked spot behind a stone that could be used for cover.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_03_05": "Hm... indeed, an unusual combination. Did you take them from there?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_15_06": "No, I didn't move anything.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_03_07": "That's good.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Next_03_01": "Before we decide anything, we need to investigate further. First, let's see if anyone suspicious is hanging around Ernesto.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Next_03_02": "I'll tell him to meet you. You and Caramon will go to Gerstand's tavern. There you must make sure Ernesto speaks loudly of his plans.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Next_03_03": "Since those suspicious things were by the ravine, have him say that he'll go up the tunnel. Just convince him to do so discreetly, the Guild can't be made a fool of!",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Next_03_04": "Caramon will keep an eye on the guests during this time. If any begin to behave strangely, discreetly follow them.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Next_03_05": "It's best if you're both in civilian clothes, we don't want to scare off our suspect. Do you understand?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Next_15_06": "I think so.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Next_03_07": "Then go get Caramon and then go to Gerstand. Stay alert.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Think_15_01": "Do you think this is some kind of trap?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Think_03_02": "I'm not sure. On the one hand, it all comes together and would fit a trap, on the other hand, what kind of idiot would set it up and leave it there?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Think_03_03": "It just begs for someone to take it away, and then there's no ambush.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Ernesto_15_01": "Ernesto will have protection?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Ernesto_03_02": "He didn't order it. The question is, will he change his mind if we describe what you found to him? And is it a good idea for him to find out?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_RoutesDone_Ernesto_03_03": "Our services should leave no doubt and save our associates trouble, not add to their questions. Damn...",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_15_01": "It's done.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_02": "I'm happy. Tell me in detail what it was about.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_15_03": "A bunch of thugs tried to attack Ernesto. All these items I found belonged to them.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_15_04": "Caramon and I convinced them that attacking our associate was a big mistake.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_05": "You were taking a risk going in there together. One of you should have gone back for reinforcements while the other waited for them. Then the Guild could have acted without risking your lives or Ernesto's.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_09": "Anyway, how bluntly did you convince them?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_15_06": "I convinced them that attacking our associate was a big mistake.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_07": "Alone? Damn, you're talented. Good thing you at least sent Caramon. He informed us that something was happening on the breakwater. But fighting alone was very unwise!",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_08": "Anyway, how bluntly did you convince them?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_15_10": "They will never repeat that mistake again. Nor will they make any other.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_11": "Great. Are you sure none of them survived?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_15_12": "Definitely. I found a letter next to one of them that confirms it.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_13": "Very good.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_15_14": "Well...",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_15": "Oh, great, so we need to do an additional investigation. All right, we'll figure it out.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_16": "As for what your action at the inn was like...",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_17": "I've been told by informants that Ernesto didn't find out about the trap. You must have handled this conversation very skillfully, congratulations.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_18": "Informants have reported to me that you are not a master of words. Ernesto is going to be stressed about the whole thing now, and who knows if we won't have to offer him protection.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_19": "In the worst case, he will cancel the deal altogether, and then no one will gain. Eh, no need to speculate, the milk has been spilled, we'll see how it goes.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_20": "I also heard you barged into the inn wearing Guild colors. Not very discreet, but the important thing is that nothing bad happened.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_21": "I hear you didn't forget to dress up so as not to cast suspicion on the Guild. Very wise of you.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_15_22": "In summary, my participation in the case can be considered complete?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA302_Finish_03_23": "Yes, it can. Here, your payment.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Start_03_01": "Marvin, the right man in the right place. There's a job to be done, basically a formality, nothing special for a true tracker.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Start_15_02": "If I get gold for this formality, why not?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Start_03_03": "That's the attitude of an Araxos man. Look, someone needs to check to see if the tracker guidelines concerning hunting grounds are still valid.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Start_03_04": "Here it is. Go to the indicated places and assess whether the facts match the description. I'm afraid that due to the current situation on the island, the animals may have changed their habits...",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Start_03_05": "Get going. We don't want anyone who's gone out to hunt scavengers to end up in an area occupied by snappers!",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Finish_15_01": "I assessed all the guidelines.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Finish_03_02": "And? Do we need to change anything?",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Finish_15_03": "As for the area around the beacon tower, everything's fine. There's still a lot of scavengers hanging around, and not much else. The rest of them is worse.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Finish_15_04": "I encountered some skeletons in the woods near Little Vineyard.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Finish_15_05": "I got rid of them, just in case.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Finish_15_06": "As for the Amber Coast, it seems that seasharks have taken a liking to it.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Finish_15_07": "I got all the ones I could find.",
  "DIA_Garos_QA303_Finish_03_08": "I understand. I'll make sure the instructions for the trackers are corrected. Good work, Marvin. Here, your reward.",
  "DIA_Garos_SQ503_Plan_15_01": "What do you think of this plan?",
  "DIA_Garos_SQ503_Plan_03_02": "It's not bad. Without Cortez, these bandits will turn into a bunch of savages with no organization or discipline. We'll take them out in a few moments.",
  "DIA_Garos_SQ503_Plan_03_03": "Just be careful out there. If he's their leader, I'm sure he can fight well.",
  "DIA_Garos_SQ503_AfterCortez_03_01": "Good job, Marvin! Wish you could have seen their faces when we attacked from behind.",
  "DIA_Garos_SQ503_AfterCortez_03_02": "In the midst of the battle, a few tried to escape into the swamp. Idiots, they underestimated the trackers of Araxos.",
  "DIA_Garos_CanYouTeach_15_00": "Could I train with you?",
  "DIA_Garos_CanYouTeach_03_01": "Of course. Like with any member of our special units, I'd be happy to teach you archery and show you how to be more dexterous.",
  "DIA_Garos_CanYouTeach_03_02": "Not yet, no. I only teach experienced members how to shoot a bow and how to be more dexterous. You're not one of them.",
  "DIA_Garos_CanYouTeach_03_03": "In case you're unclear, you also need to remember that rank isn't everything. If you don't know anything, I won't teach you the basics. I don't have time for that.",
  "DIA_Garos_CanYouTeach_03_04": "And by the way, I also know about hunting. It's not my job to teach others in this area so you'd have to put up some gold, but I'm sure we'll come to an understanding.",
  "DIA_Garos_CanYouTeach_03_05": "If you know the basics, I could teach you how to pull out fangs, claws, shadowbeast's horns and fire lizards' tongues, or how to skin reptiles. Interested?",
  "DIA_Garos_Teach_15_00": "I want to train.",
  "DIA_Garos_NoMore_03_01": "How ridiculous! Someone like you doesn't need training anymore, at most they can train others!",
  "DIA_Garos_Teach_03_01": "Just prepare accordingly.",
  "DIA_Garos_Teach_B1_03_00": "I told you, I don't have time to teach the basics. Practice with someone else first.",
  "DIA_Garos_Teach_B1_03_01": "A small step towards the mastery.",
  "DIA_Garos_Teach_B5_03_02": "I told you, I don't have time to teach the basics. Practice with someone else first.",
  "DIA_Garos_Teach_B5_03_03": "Nice, you're making progress.",
  "DIA_Garos_TeachDEX1_03_00": "I told you, I don't have time to teach the basics. Practice with someone else first.",
  "DIA_Garos_TeachDEX1_03_01": "A small step towards the mastery.",
  "DIA_Garos_TeachDEX5_03_00": "I told you, I don't have time to teach the basics. Practice with someone else first.",
  "DIA_Garos_TeachDEX5_03_01": "Nice, you're making progress.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsNews_15_01": "Did any of the warlords reveal themselves?",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsNews_03_02": "I recently received word that hunters had spotted one of these on the Lurkers' Coast.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsNews_03_03": "Weigar! Show for once that you can actually shoot. You have a rendezvous point in the woods near the Coast, you will depart from there.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsNews_03_04": "I also have information that the warlord has arrived at the camp in the swamp.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsNews_03_05": "Adelard! Show everyone how the Araxos elite fight!",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsNews_03_06": "Just don't get killed.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsRoundTwo_15_01": "We got rid of the orcs in the swamps and the Lurkers' Coast.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsRoundTwo_03_02": "You arrive just in time. The orc leader has appeared dangerously close to Rita's vineyard, in the tunnels.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsRoundTwo_03_04": "Oktav! I know you've always carried that sword just for decoration, but the time has come to swing it. Don't worry, it won't dull!",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsRoundTwo_03_05": "Gather around the small vineyard and attack while they are not expecting us.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsRoundTwo_03_06": "The time to attack the old lighthouse had also come.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_OrcsRoundTwo_03_07": "I'm leaving immediately, but if you want to take care of the warlord in the vineyard first, I can wait.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_Ready_15_01": "Do you have a plan on how to get to the lighthouse?",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_Ready_03_02": "We've just taken care of evacuating the fishermen. We'll wait until nightfall and borrow one of their boats to get to the other side.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_Ready_03_03": "You must be on full alert. The fight will begin the exact moment we go ashore.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_LetsAttack_15_01": "Let's get to work.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_AfterFight_03_01": "Why do they always give us the worst jobs?",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_AfterFight_03_02": "I'd rather fight in the swamp than on this damn island!",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_AfterFight_15_03": "Believe me, it was just as hard there.",
  "DIA_Garos_KQ407_AfterFight_03_04": "Maybe you're right. I'm going to stay here and look around for more clues about the rest of the warlords.",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier2_03_01": "Congratulations. I rarely have the pleasure of confirming someone's nomination for a second class tracker!",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier2_15_02": "Confirming? Then who put it forward?",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier2_03_03": "Top secret Guild business. I think you'll find this armor much more interesting, one of the best you can get on Archolos!",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier2_03_04": "You have a huge responsibility now. With the armor I gave you, you should be able to handle it, but if you also need a better weapon, talk to Ingor.",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier2_03_05": "The guy has some really great equipment for sale, probably even better than what paladins fight with on the front lines!",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier2_15_06": "I'm glad, and thanks for the promotion. I'll try not to boss people around too much.",
  "DIA_Garos_Promotion_Tier2_03_07": "Well, I hope so!",
  "DIA_Garos_Hello_09_01": "I am Garos, I command the hunters of the Araxos Merchant's Guild. Only here on Archolos, of course. What is it?",
  "DIA_Garos_Ambient_15_00": "How are you doing?",
  "DIA_Garos_Ambient_13_01": "We have a lot of work because the situation on the island is getting more and more tense. But we can do it, Araxos always comes through.",
  "DIA_Garos_Ambient_13_02": "I'm thinking of giving you some extra training. We need to maintain the reputation of the unit and not sit on our laurels.",
  "DIA_Garos_Ambient_13_03": "I hope you're not abusing your position in our ranks too much. If not, it's all right with me.",
  "DIA_Garos_Ambient_13_04": "I'm fine, Adelard's lackey. Don't look at me like that, I have no problem with your decision. But you'd do better as a tracker.",
  "DIA_Garos_Ambient_13_05": "I'm still impressed with how far you've come. Araxos could use more people like that.",
  "DIA_Garos_Ambient_13_06": "All is well in the Araxos Merchant's Guild. Anything you need? You want to do business with us?",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_03_01": "If you keep gold in mind, yes.",
  "DIA_Garos_AllHunt_03_01": "Damn, you're good. I can't teach you anything.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_Teeth_15_01": "How do you obtain animal fangs?",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_Teeth_03_02": "You use a sharp object to get at their roots, and when they are visible, you lever them or pull them out. It's not particularly difficult.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_Teeth_03_03": "Look, you know how this works. The gold has to match.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_Claws_15_01": "How do you obtain animal claws?",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_Claws_03_02": "You pull them out and cut deep, all the way to the bone, then you yank hard. Most of it comes off with the tendons, which you peel off. You won't need them.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_Claws_03_03": "Look, you know how this works. The gold has to match.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_FireTongue_15_01": "How do you rip out the tongues of fire lizards?",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_FireTongue_03_02": "In this case, you have to watch out for burns. Their tongues are often hot, especially right after a kill. The ripping itself is pretty easy.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_FireTongue_03_03": "You pull out as much of the tongue as you can manage, take something sharp, and cut it off deep in the throat.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_FireTongue_03_04": "Look, you know how this works. The gold has to match.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_ReptileSkin_15_01": "How do you skin reptiles?",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_ReptileSkin_03_02": "This requires less precision but more strength than skinning other animals. It's best to start the incision by sticking something sharp between the scales.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_ReptileSkin_03_03": "When you manage to make as such a gap, you grab it and start peeling off the skin. Like I said, it takes some strength, but I'm sure you can handle it.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_ReptileSkin_03_04": "Look, you know how this works. The gold has to match.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_ShadowHorn_15_01": "How do you obtain shadowbeast horns?",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_ShadowHorn_03_02": "If you manage to defeat one, then examine where the skin overlaps the horn. Cut it there, which will allow you to find the horn base.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_ShadowHorn_03_03": "Lever it with some strong tool, and then start yanking it from side to side. Eventually, it should pop out of the skull.",
  "DIA_Garos_Hunting_Special_ShadowHorn_03_04": "Look, you know how this works. The gold has to match.",
  "DIA_Garos_Bounty_15_01": "I want to collect the reward for the beast I hunted.",
  "DIA_Garos_Bounty_GoodJob_03_01": "Excellent, that filth has caused problems long enough.",
