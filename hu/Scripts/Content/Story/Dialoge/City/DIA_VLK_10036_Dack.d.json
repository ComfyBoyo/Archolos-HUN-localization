  "DIA_Dack_SQ203_Finish_15_01": "Knut sent me to give you his offer.",
  "DIA_Dack_SQ203_Finish_03_02": "Let me see that letter.",
  "DIA_Dack_SQ203_Finish_03_03": "The best wood on the island?",
  "DIA_Dack_SQ203_Finish_03_04": "That wood may be good, but Ulryk's offer has messed with his head! The shipyard can't pay him that much...",
  "DIA_Dack_SQ203_Finish_03_05": "Since he sent a messenger to me, that means he's probably running out of contract with the Wolf Sons. We'll see how he sings in a few months. I'll send him a reply by a runner.",
  "DIA_Dack_SQ203_Finish_03_06": "Well done boy, you had a long way to go, all the way from the woodcutter's camp itself.",
  "DIA_Dack_SQ203_Finish_03_07": "Here's some gold as a reward. You'll get some good beer at the Siren's Wail for it!",
  "DIA_Dack_Hello_15_01": "What are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Dack_Hello_03_02": "I'm the boss of this beautiful shipyard. I tell you, there's not another one like it in the whole kingdom!",
  "DIA_Dack_Hello_03_03": "My main job is to design ships, make sure deadlines are met and well-deserved salaries are paid.",
  "DIA_Dack_Hello_03_04": "In the years of our greatest splendor, we even launched several warships a year.",
  "DIA_Dack_Hello_03_05": "Unfortunately, many of our best craftsmen have been called to the front lines and building new ships no longer goes as smoothly as it once did.",
  "DIA_Dack_Ambient_03_02": "A day like any other. The wood is getting worse, the workers are getting lazier, and the royals are rushing us more and more.",
  "DIA_Dack_Ambient_03_01": "If you were ever in the Wolf's Den, you might seek out my son, Foral. The boy is more enamored with Ulryk and the Wolf Sons than with his old father.",
  "DIA_Dack_CanYouTeach_15_01": "Can you teach me something?",
  "DIA_Dack_CanYouTeach_03_02": "I can show you some tricks on how to harvest wood efficiently. Who knows, maybe someday you'll be a carpenter and be of some use to us here.",
  "DIA_Dack_Son_15_01": "I met your son.",
  "DIA_Dack_Son_03_02": "Is he all right?",
  "DIA_Dack_Son_15_03": "That's what it looks like. I think he's happy there. Especially when he finds out you're not trying to force him into the shipyard.",
  "DIA_Dack_Son_03_04": "The important thing is that he's okay. It's been a while since I gave up hope that he would ever take over this place from me. Thank you for telling me about it, my friend."
