  "DIA_Propagandist_Poster_15_01": "Give me one.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_Poster_03_02": "Go ahead, they're free.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_Poster_Who_15_01": "Who is the author of these flyers?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_Poster_Who_03_02": "Probably the same good soul who attempted to take Volker's life. The boy doesn't even realize what he's accomplished with that one shot.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_Poster_Who_15_03": "What do you think he accomplished?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_Poster_Who_03_04": "Something big.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_Poster_Who_03_05": "He set in motion a force that not even Rhobar's own army could stop!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_15_01": "Do you have more of these flyers?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_03_02": "I do, but a limited amount, so everyone gets one. We want them to go to as many citizens as possible.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_15_03": "What do you mean by 'we'?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_03_04": "Well... other people of good will.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Where_15_01": "Where are the other agitators?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Where_03_02": "Agitators? That's a pretty derogatory term.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Where_03_03": "Personally, I prefer 'truth tellers', but in truth, none of us take credit for doing the right thing.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Where_03_04": "Actually... why do you need this information?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Defeat_15_01": "So that I can more easily break up this rabble of yours and put every one of you in the dungeon.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Defeat_03_02": "I might have expected you to be completely overtaken with royal propaganda!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Defeat_15_03": "So that I can more easily break up this rabble of yours and turn each of you over to the guards.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Defeat_03_04": "But I was wrong about you. You're just an errand boy!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Defeat_03_05": "If you try to touch me, you will have the lives of innocent citizens on your conscience!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_More_15_01": "I partially agree with what you are saying. I would like to know more about your movement.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_More_03_02": "We have no 'movement'. No one pays us or leads us.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_More_03_03": "We are just ordinary citizens with a common goal.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_More_03_04": "Admittedly, there are still not enough of us, but that will soon change.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Leader_15_01": "In my opinion, you need a leader - someone to guide you smoothly.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Leader_03_02": "Our strength is in numbers, not power. Power corrupts!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Leader_03_03": "Sooner or later this 'someone' would use their position to threaten citizens or simply be bribed by the City Hall.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Leader_03_04": "We need people, not a leader.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_15_03": "I really want to help you.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_03_04": "Somehow I don't believe your good intentions.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_03_05": "If you actually wanted to help us, you would know what our values are.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_03_06": "As far as I'm concerned, you're just a spy!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_03_08": "If you know people who have the good of this city in their hearts, tell them to come behind the shipyard.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_03_09": "My friend Ludlof is speaking there.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_03_10": "Maybe if they saw that there were normal people among you too, they would be more likely to join the rally?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_15_11": "Thanks, I will.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_15_01": "Perhaps I could convince other city guards to support your cause.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_03_02": "Help from the city guard is the last thing I would expect!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Militia_03_07": "I see, however, that my words have moved you, stranger.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Araxos_15_01": "Perhaps I could convince others to support your cause.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Araxos_03_02": "Both servants of the authorities and merciless mercenaries can stand behind this term!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Araxos_03_03": "Then again, looking at you, appearances are deceiving...",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_15_01": "What are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_03_02": "I'm taking the opportunity to proclaim the uncomfortable for the authorities truth.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_15_03": "What do you mean you're taking the opportunity?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_03_04": "If the governor does not agree to our demands, it is possible that he won't stop at nothing, and will soon ban us from the streets or put us in jail.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_03_05": "There must be as many of us as possible before that happens. That is the only way we will force him to change his policy.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_Demands_15_01": "What are your demands?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_Demands_03_02": "First, we demand that the freedoms of the nobility and rich citizens be restricted. Secondly, we do not agree with forced conscription into the army.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_Demands_03_03": "And third, we don't want strangers here.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_Governor_15_01": "What is the governor's view on this?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_Governor_03_02": "Such that he was ready to close the city off and cut it off from the rest of the island!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_Governor_15_03": "The authorities claim that the reason for this was the arrival of refugees. This way it will be easier for the guards to control them.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_Governor_03_04": "Do you believe that crap? Cause I don't. They're preparing something big, I can feel it in my bones.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_What_Governor_03_05": "Morris won't talk to us for now, but we'll find a way to convince him.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_GoAway_15_01": "Get out of this place or I'll throw you out by force.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_GoAway_03_02": "It's a free country and I'll do as I please!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_GoAway_03_03": "If you try to touch me, you will have the lives of innocent citizens on your conscience!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AfterFight_03_01": "Ah... My head... Ah... What do you want from me?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AfterFight_15_02": "Tell me who gave you the flyers, only this time without any nonsense.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AfterFight_03_03": "Flyers? Th-they were lying on the street, so I took them...",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AfterFight_15_05": "I'll ask one last time - where did you get them?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AfterFight_03_06": "No! No! Please don't hit me!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AfterFight_03_07": "L-Ludlof... y-you'll find him in the back of the shipyard...!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AfterFight_Easy_15_01": "See how easy it went? You could have done it right away.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AfterFight_Easy_03_02": "Y-yeah... y-you're right.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AfterFight_Easy_15_03": "Now get out of here.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AmbientMad_03_01": "I have as much right to be here as you do!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AmbientMad_03_02": "I don't talk to authorities' minions!",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AmbientMad_03_03": "W-what more do you w-want...?",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AmbientMad_03_04": "Because of people like you, this city is going to the dogs.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Where_Defeat_Choice": "So I can more easily break up this rabble of yours.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Where_More_Choice": "I would like to learn more about your movement.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Where_More_Leader_Choice": "In my opinion, you need a leader.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Where_More_Militia_Choice": "Perhaps other city guards would support your cause.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_MorePosters_Where_More_Araxos_Choice": "I may know someone who would support your cause.",
  "DIA_Propagandist_AfterFight_Easy_Choice": "See how easy it went?"
