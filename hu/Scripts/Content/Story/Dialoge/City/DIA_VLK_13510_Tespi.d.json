  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_15_01": "Aren't you looking for a job?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_03_02": "What are you, blind? I'm relaxing with a beer now, what else do I need to do?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_15_03": "I meant, more like, don't you need some work in general... Because I would have something to offer.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_03_04": "Yeah, I can see by you what the job is. You want me to snitch on the neighbors, huh? I'll tell you right now, get lost! I won't be an informer!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_03_05": "Like what?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_15_06": "You see, I've been a city guard for a while now...",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_03_07": "WHAT?! A guard? So what, I'm supposed to snitch on the neighbors, right? No, I won't be an informer!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_15_08": "I'm not talking about snitching. I wanted to offer you a chance to join the guard.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_03_09": "What? Me in the guard? What would that do for me that honest work in the field doesn't?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Good_03_08": "You know what, I can't listen to all this right now, but I will definitely think about everything you told me and get back to you.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Good_03_09": "See you later!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Good_15_01": "Everything! They pay really well, and you don't have to work a lot. All you have to do is walk around the city, and you get enough coins for a few nights at the inn!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Good_03_02": "Really? Then why do I see so few of you at the inn?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Good_15_03": "You know, we like to organize various celebrations in the barracks, to which ordinary people are not invited. What happens there is hard to describe, you have to experience it yourself!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Good_15_04": "And the food! The quartermaster provides us with rations so large and so tasty that we always walk around full!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Good_03_05": "Seriously? Hm, that sounds very good... but then why does the guard have such a bad reputation?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Good_15_06": "You know, if everyone knew what it was really like, they'd be banging on our doors and windows.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Good_15_07": "We need to make the right selections of recruits so that we have only those who are really suitable in our ranks.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Truth_15_01": "The Guard, like everything, has its pros and cons. We get good equipment, a roof over our heads, people mostly listen to you, because whatever your opinion of us is, the uniform still inspires respect.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Truth_03_02": "Yeah, I know something about that.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Truth_15_03": "There you go. Yes, the earnings, especially at the beginning, are not very high, but you can easily live on it on a fairly decent level.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Truth_15_04": "I could also complain about the food, because the quartermaster is not particularly eager to take care of our full bellies...",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Truth_03_05": "Oh, that's not good... walking around with an empty stomach is like leaving a tavern sober.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Truth_15_06": "There's something to that. But we have our own medic who will get you back on your feet for free if something happens to you. Sometimes that really saves your skin.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Truth_03_07": "I don't doubt it. Listening to you, serving in the guard doesn't sound terribly bad...",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Truth_15_08": "Because it's not. So what do you say? Are you going to give us a shot?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_01": "Is it really that good? Good food, roof over your head, few responsibilities, high pay?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_02": "That's right. I joined the unit because when I worked with my parents on the farm, we were almost starving. Now, I'm not only living in much better conditions, I'm also helping them.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_03": "Thanks to me, they became some of the wealthiest villagers!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_04": "Damn, that's really not bad...",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_05": "Not really. The service certainly has a lot of advantages, but of course, it's not perfect. The pay could be higher, they feed us a little poorly, but overall it's not bad.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_06": "It should also be noted that if you try your best, they clearly treat you better. It is worth giving your best in our company.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_07": "Hm, sounds a little different than what your buddy told me.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_08": "Apparently, serving in the guard may not be ideal, but it has a few perks. Is that true?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_09": "Disadvantages? I don't see them! They pay well, feed well, give you a roof over your head, and you don't have to work hard at all!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_10": "Joining this organization was the best decision I could have made, and the best decision any human being can make!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_11": "Damn, that's even better than what your friend said...",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_12": "True. Sometimes I miss decent home cooked meals, I have to count every coin because they don't pay me enough to afford everything.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_13": "I bet that when I earn a higher rank, some of the flaws will go away. It's really good motivation to keep trying.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_14": "Hm, what you guys are saying sounds pretty interesting...",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_15": "Now at least I have a broader view of what it looks like over there. But I'd like to check one more thing...",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_15_16": "Just tell me what it is.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_17": "The orcs are a growing threat to the island. When they get here, I don't want to rely on the guard alone, so if I were to join you, I'd like to know how well would you train me.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_15_18": "How would you like to check that?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_03_19": "For a long time, my father's field has been occupied by a family of field raiders. You could show what you can do by helping me get rid of them.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_No_15_01": "We were not instructed to do so by the commander, so I'm sorry, but we won't help you.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_No_03_02": "Of course, I might have expected that. It's the kind of service that if you have to do something for an honest man, you back off right away?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_No_03_03": "But I won't push it. You're scared of a couple of overgrown insects, so you're not worth bothering with. Goodbye.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_Yes_15_01": "Just get us there, we'll take care of the rest.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_Yes_03_02": "And that's the point! Sure, follow me. Shit, if you guys are so helpful, it might actually be worth joining you...",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_Yes_03_03": "Even despite your tendency to make things up.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_Yes_03_04": "I'll think about it later. Let's go!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Filed_03_01": "Here we are. I can see the damn things from here!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Filed_15_02": "There aren't that many. We can handle it.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Filed_03_03": "I hope so. I'll stay here, I'd only get in the way in a fight. After all, I haven't trained as a guard!",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Filed_15_04": "Good decision. Give us a minute, it'll be over soon.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_FieldClear_03_01": "Now that's what I call a professional job! Did you learn all this in the guard?",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_FieldClear_15_02": "That is correct. During training, we learned the technique, and during the mission, we learned how to put it into practice.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_FieldClear_03_03": "Damn, if I could do that, I could help my dad with chasing those beasts away...",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_FieldClear_15_04": "Join us, you'll learn both that and much more.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_FieldClear_03_05": "Yeah, well... who knows, maybe I'll do it. In the meantime, thanks for your help. And, perhaps, I'll see you around.",
  "DIA_Tespi_NotSure_09_01": "I'm still thinking about your offer. But maybe I'll do it.",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Good_Choice": "(Speak only positively)",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Job_Truth_Choice": "(Speak frankly)",
  "DIA_Tespi_QM202_Truth_No_Choice": "We won't do it."
