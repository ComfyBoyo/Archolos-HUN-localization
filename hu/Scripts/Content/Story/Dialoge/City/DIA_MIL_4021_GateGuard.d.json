  "DIA_4021_CityGuard_ToCity_Cutter_02_04": "Well, well, someone's planning a bigger deal. There will be some gold in it.",

  "DIA_CityGuard_Q312_WaitASec_What_03_04": "It's best if you go straight to Roderich. He needs everyone's guard up right now to clear up all the confusion, and he's not in the best of moods.",
