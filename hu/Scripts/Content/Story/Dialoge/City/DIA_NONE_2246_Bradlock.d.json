  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_03_03": "Really? And for what purpose do you want to see him?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_NotBad_03_09": "Follow me and keep your hands to yourself. Otherwise, you'll be saying goodbye to them quickly.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_CanGo_15_01": "Does that mean you'll take me to Volker?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Work_15_01": "I want to work for him.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Work_03_02": "What makes you think Volker would have any use for you?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_15_01": "I'm here about the investigation.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_03_02": "Investigation?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_15_03": "The commander sent me to determine the identity of the assassin.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_03_04": "I thought your people had already caught whoever they needed to catch.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_15_05": "The governor wants to make sure we have the right person.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_03_06": "I see the city guards are reliable as usual.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_15_07": "The Guild's chairman sent me to determine the identity of the assassin.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_03_08": "As far as I know, the guards have already apprehended the culprit.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_15_09": "Lorenzo says it's just a cover-up.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_03_10": "I see the rumblings between the Guild and the guard continue at their best.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_03_11": "On the other hand, Volker himself mentioned...",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_15_12": "Mentioned what?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_03_13": "Actually...",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Investigation_03_14": "It doesn't matter. If he wants to, he'll tell you himself.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Skill_15_01": "I have a number of valuable skills that I have gained from many field assignments.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Skill_03_02": "A number of skills?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Skill_03_03": "I heard the exact same thing from one guy. Unfortunately, that same day some thugs killed him before he could get to my boss.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Skill_03_04": "As you can see, words are not everything.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_NotBad_15_01": "If I was him, I could take those thugs. I even managed to beat Big Ben, who...",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_NotBad_03_02": "Did you say 'Big Ben'? The Ben?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_NotBad_15_03": "Ben from the Haven. Is there another one?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_NotBad_03_04": "Did you kill him?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_NotBad_15_05": "It wasn't easy because the guy had the paws of a troll, but somehow I managed.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_NotBad_15_06": "I defeated him in battle, but I spared his life.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_NotBad_03_07": "That's no small accomplishment.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_NotBad_03_08": "Looks like my boss is going to find a moment for you after all.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_VOLKERTRIALOG_03_01": "Boss... some boy wants to work for you.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Description": "What do you know about the assassination?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_15_01": "Apparently you were on the grounds of the mansion at the time of the assassination. What can you tell me about that event?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_03_02": "What makes you think I'd want to talk to you about that?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_15_03": "Your boss said you'd answer my questions. Besides, I'm here to help.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_03_04": "I was where I always was - with Volker.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_15_05": "Apparently you weren't too close to him. He was this close to getting killed.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_03_06": "Don't mock me, punk. I didn't leave his side!",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Info_15_01": "And yet, by some miracle, the attempt happened.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Info_03_02": "Whoever attacked my boss wasn't just some scum from the slums.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Info_15_03": "Most people think otherwise.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Info_03_04": "Most people are idiots.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Info_03_05": "I saw the way he moved. Guy clearly came here for one purpose.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Info_03_06": "If that kid hadn't been in the firing line, he would have collected his last paycheck a few days ago.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Boy_15_01": "Tell me about this boy.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Boy_03_02": "His name was Norman. The kid was about your age. He stumbled here not too long ago.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Boy_15_03": "Stumbled?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Boy_03_04": "One of ours offered him a job at Volker's, and since he met the requirements, the boss agreed to take him on a trial period.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Boy_03_05": "There wasn't much use for him though. I tried to teach him to fight, but the shithead just wasted my time.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Boy_03_06": "At least he did a pretty good job as a water carrier.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Boy_15_07": "And a living shield.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Boy_03_08": "There's no denying it.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Bolt_15_01": "Do you have the bolthead with you?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Bolt_03_02": "What the hell do you need the bolthead for?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Bolt_15_03": "Maybe it can tell us more about the weapon the assassin fired.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Bolt_03_04": "The guards probably got rid of it a long time ago, and if not, you'll find it in the graveyard two meters underground in the body of that snot.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Bolt_03_05": "I already told you everything I know.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Informations_Bolt_03_06": "Now leave me alone.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_03_01": "Oh, kid, good morning. Unfortunately, the boss isn't accepting anyone right now.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_15_02": "This is very important. I have information regarding the attempt on his life.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_03_03": "I appreciate you working so hard for us, but the boss is very well protected and we don't need to drone on about it at the moment. Anything else to report?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Why_15_01": "Why doesn't Volker let anyone in?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Why_03_02": "Recently some commotion started in the city, I think the Royal Envoy sailed in. Since then, the chief has forbidden anyone to enter.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Why_15_03": "Even the matter of the attempt on his life is not worth breaking an order?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Why_03_04": "I could only break them if King Rhobar himself came here. Though I would still hesitate.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Ivy_15_01": "Has Ivy been here lately?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Ivy_03_02": "No, I haven't seen her in a while. Didn't she go to the Den with you?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Ivy_15_03": "Yeah, but she disappeared somewhere. I thought she might have come back here.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Ivy_03_04": "No, she's not back.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Bandits_15_01": "I was attacked by several people in the Den.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Bandits_15_02": "They may also have belonged to this organization harming the city.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Bandits_03_03": "Did you interrogate them?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Bandits_15_04": "I had no way. The fight started before I could ask for anything.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_Bandits_03_05": "Then we have no way to test your suspicions.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_NearEnd_15_01": "I'm close to finding out where this organization's hideout is.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_NearEnd_03_02": "Mere suspicion doesn't interest me. If you have a clue, check it out, then report back to me if it checks out.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_AfterMine_NearEnd_03_03": "Go on, you're interrupting my work.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_CantPass_03_01": "Kid, I won't let you in, you have no business coming here.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Canyouteachme_15_00": "Could you teach me something?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Canyouteachme_03_01": "Do you always approach people like that and just ask if they will teach you something?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Canyouteachme_15_02": "No, I only approach those who look like they can teach me something.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Canyouteachme_03_03": "That's pretty clever. All right, if you can do something, and you've got the gold, I'll show you how to get strong.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Train_15_00": "Let's start training.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Train_03_01": "Show me what you got.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Train_Back_03_00": "Not bad, you know a lot already.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Train_Back_03_01": "Well, there it is. I won't teach you any more, because who ever saw a student outgrow a master?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Train_STR1_13_00": "Hehe, good joke! It's been a long time since anyone mistook me for a charity!",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Train_STR1_13_01": "You think I want to teach a rookie like you?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Train_STR5_13_00": "If you want such an intense workout, you also need to pay accordingly.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Train_STR5_13_01": "Judging by your skills I'm not surprised you want to train so much, but I don't have time for beginners.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_HELLO_15_01": "Nice house.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_HELLO_03_02": "Isn't that right? You have to admit, Mr. Volker has great taste.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_HELLO_15_03": "Can I come inside?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_HELLO_03_04": "It depends...",
  "DIA_Bradlock_HELLO_03_05": "If Volker is expecting you, you're welcome. Though in my opinion that is unlikely.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Volker_15_01": "Who is this Volker guy?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Volker_03_02": "For you, Mr. Volker, young man. You really don't know him?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Volker_15_03": "I'm new to Archolos. I haven't met everyone in town yet.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Volker_03_04": "You probably won't know everyone, but you should know Volker.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Volker_03_05": "Mr. Volker is the richest man in town.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Volker_03_06": "It is thanks to him that trade and craft flourish in our city.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Volker_15_07": "Is he a member of the city council?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Volker_03_08": "Haha! As if a bunch of bureaucrats are doing anything for the good of the city.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Volker_03_09": "No. The Honorable Mr. Volker provides attractive loans for those who want to expand their business.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Volker_03_10": "As long as there is some potential in it.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Loan_15_01": "And can I apply for a loan?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Loan_03_02": "I don't know you, boy. And that means you can't.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Loan_03_03": "Besides, you said you were new here. There's nothing to talk about.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Start_15_01": "Do you have a job for me?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Start_03_02": "I don't know you. No way.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Start_15_03": "One of your men sent me here. He said you might need someone who is trusted by the people of the vineyard.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Start_03_04": "You don't let go easily, do you?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Start_03_05": "There is one thing that keeps Volker up at night.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Start_03_06": "I was going to pass his request along to one of our people, but since you're here.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Start_03_07": "Here. Read exactly what you need to do. If you prove yourself, I'll recommend you to Volker.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_15_01": "I have a few questions...",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_03_02": "I should have seen it coming. Ask.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Anderas_15_01": "What can you tell me about Andreas.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Anderas_03_02": "The younger of the Valerio brothers. According to the will, he was to take over the Great Vineyard.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Anderas_03_03": "Until his brother forced him out of the house.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Anderas_03_04": "Andreas now has a close associate, Gerhard.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Anderas_03_05": "In my opinion, he would be better suited for business. Volker sometimes met with him and was quite impressed.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Anderas_03_06": "Believe me - he is not an easily impressed men.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Holdwig_15_01": "Do you know anything about Holdwig?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Holdwig_03_02": "Not much. As the older of the brothers, he expected his father to be the one to bequeath the entire estate to him.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Holdwig_03_03": "And he was sorely mistaken.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Holdwig_03_04": "Apparently his father always kept him close, so he certainly knows a thing or two about growing grapes.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Holdwig_03_05": "He's rarely in town. I don't think he can do a good trade.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Holdwig_15_06": "Where to find him?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Holdwig_03_07": "What do you think? Where might the vineyard owner be present?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Holdwig_15_08": "Forget I asked.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Holdwig_03_09": "I already forgot.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Where_15_01": "Where can I find him?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Where_03_02": "His family has a home in the upper city.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Where_03_03": "I'll call one of the guys right away to let the guards know Andreas is expecting you.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Where_03_04": "They will escort you to the gates.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Where_03_05": "Anything else?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_03_01": "How did it go?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Volker_15_01": "Shouldn't I report to the boss?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Volker_03_02": "No. You have to report to me.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Holdwig_03_05": "Come here tomorrow. I'll give the news to Volker.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Holdwig_03_06": "I feel a heavy bag of gold waiting for you.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Holdwig_15_01": "Holdwig has full control of the vineyard.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Holdwig_03_02": "Okay. Were there any problems?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Holdwig_15_03": "It's minor. Nothing I'd have more trouble with.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Holdwig_03_04": "Great, the boss likes smooth action.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Andreas_15_01": "Andreas regained control of the vineyard.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Andreas_03_02": "Interesting. I guess you had to put some effort into it?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Andreas_15_03": "I do my best with everything.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Andreas_03_04": "Yeah, sure. The boss will probably appreciate it.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Liam_15_01": "The brothers manage the vineyard together.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Liam_03_02": "What?! What do you mean? Did you make peace with them?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Liam_15_03": "Yes. I 'found' a new version of Valerio's will in which he orders that the estate be ruled jointly by Andreas and Holdwig.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Finish_Liam_03_04": "I didn't expect this turn of events.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_15_01": "What about my reward?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_03_02": "And I was already hoping that all the gold would stay with me.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_15_10": "I thought Volker paid more generously for his work. Wasn't he happy?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_03_11": "He was, and very much so. Unfortunately, he will need the gold badly to help the reconciled brothers.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_03_12": "You understand. For the sake of Archolos.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_15_13": "It's better than nothing.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_15_03": "Boss happy?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_03_04": "Very. And this is an expression of his gratitude.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_15_05": "That's a lot.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_03_06": "There would have been more, but I had to charge a commission for myself.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_03_07": "If it weren't for my goodwill, you wouldn't have the opportunity to make money. Wouldn't you?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_15_08": "True. You did the noble thing.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Reward_03_09": "Well, I think so.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_15_01": "There's something Volker needs to know!",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_03_02": "Take it easy. Whatever it is you can pass it on to me - there's no need to keep Mr Volker busy with petty matters.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_15_01": "Why do you allow your people to make life miserable for honest citizens?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_03_02": "Wait, what? What are you talking about?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_15_03": "One of your men regularly threatens and robs Frida. You're not gonna tell me you don't know anything about this?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_03_04": "WHAT?! Which one is it?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_15_05": "The one with the horrible scar on his face.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_03_06": "Will you wait a minute?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_03_07": "We have someone in our ranks who seems to think he can harm our boss's interests.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_03_08": "Would you care to explain to him that things are a little different here?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_03_09": "Excellent. Now back to you...",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_03_10": "First of all, I am very sorry that this situation happened at all. I'm glad you informed me about it.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_03_11": "Second, please take this apology letter to the esteemed Frida.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_03_12": "Third, I hope this purse makes up for her losses. And don't even think about keeping it for yourself.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_03_13": "Later today I'm going to go to her in person to apologize for the whole mess.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Fast_15_01": "You get business done quickly.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Fast_03_02": "Someone has to take care of Mr. Volker's reputation.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_CanGo_NotNice_15_01": "Does that mean you'll take me to the Usurer?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_CanGo_NotNice_03_02": "MR. VOLKER! I don't know where you heard that name, but try to forget it as soon as possible.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Ambient_13_01": "I'm not used to talking to guards like that. You sure you don't have an order to carry out?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Ambient_13_02": "What? Are you trying to buy your way into my good graces? Lorenzo doesn't pay as much as he used to?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Ambient_13_03": "I'm sure you've got more important things on your mind than bothering me fruitlessly.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Ambient_13_04": "It doesn't matter. What matters is how you're doing. Volker's counting on you in this investigation.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Ambient_13_05": "You did a good job, kid, so I accept your presence, but don't push your luck.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Ambient_13_06": "I've been better. For instance, when no one was buzzing in my ear.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_FreeArmor_03_01": "Good to see you. Listen, you have the potential to be one of Volker's bodyguards.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Freearmor_03_02": "First the vineyard case, now this investigation, you know how to achieve your goal and you're not afraid to get your hands dirty along the way.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_FreeArmor_03_03": "We don't hire guards with us and I can't make an exception for you, but I have something here as a reward for your help so far.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_FreeArmor_03_04": "Our boys don't like Guild mercenaries very much, so I can't offer you a job with us, but I have something here as a reward for your help so far.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_FreeArmor_03_05": "It is exactly the same armor as the rest of Volker's bodyguards wear. Durable, comfortable, and above all, unobtrusive in the city or in the wilderness.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_FreeArmor_03_06": "Good luck in the Wolf's Den and watch out for those guys, I've never been fond of them.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Work_03_03": "Hmmm... you came in handy last time...",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Work_03_04": "Well boy, you earned your visit.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ225_Questions_Anderas_Choice": "What can you tell me about Andreas?",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Work_Skill_Choice": "I have valuable skills.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_Q308Hello_Work_Skill_NotBad_Choice": "I deal with thugs pretty well.",
  "DIA_Bradlock_SQ207_Volker_Why_Choice": "Why do you allow your men to make life miserable for honest citizens?"
