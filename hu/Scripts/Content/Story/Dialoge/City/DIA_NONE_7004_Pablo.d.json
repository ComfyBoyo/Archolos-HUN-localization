  "DIA_NONE_7004_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_03_01": "Easy, boy, easy!",
  "DIA_NONE_7004_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_03_02": "Let's talk about all this! You're from the Merchant's Guild, right? Believe me, you don't want to kill me.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Next_03_01": "You seem like a business man to me. You know how to spot a good offer and make a deal. I have something I can offer you in exchange for my freedom.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Next_03_02": "Your friend's been hanging around our drop point. Let's put it this way, he's in for a nasty surprise.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Next_03_03": "If you care about his life, I can take you to him and talk to my colleagues to let you go.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Next_03_04": "At the end, we'll all go our separate ways and forget the whole thing.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Kill_15_01": "You were the one who just tried to kill me!",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Why_15_01": "Why wouldn't I?",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Finbar_15_01": "Why did you kill Finbar?",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Finbar_03_02": "And did you not hear me ask my companions exactly the same thing?",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Finbar_03_03": "If it changes anything, it surprised me even more than it surprised you. Finbar was a good guy and I even liked him.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Finbar_03_04": "He simply robbed the wrong people, and the robbed decided to take revenge.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Guys_15_01": "So you're the ones doing the smuggling?",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Guys_03_02": "If it weren't for us, half of the harbor would no longer be able to afford a solid piece of fish for dinner.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Guys_03_03": "All those taxes for war, for the King, for the guard, for the rulers of the island, and of course, the countless duties of the Merchant's Guild.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Guys_03_04": "Smuggling allows you to distribute goods so that everyone benefits... and it also allows the smarter people to earn a few gold coins.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Guys_03_05": "Me and the guys are only responsible for making sure that goods go safely from the harbor to the warehouse. What happens to them before and after doesn't interest me much.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Guild_15_01": "The guild wants to get rid of you.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Guild_03_02": "I'm not particularly surprised. Lorenzo probably goes crazy when he thinks about all the gold that passes right under his nose.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Guild_03_03": "I'll warn you, if you kill me, you won't gain anything, three more people will appear in my place. Whether they be slumdogs, Southerners or refugees.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Leader_15_01": "Who is your leader?",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Leader_03_02": "You think I know any names? I don't even know who delivers these goods to the harbor, let alone who runs it all.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Leader_03_03": "Believe me, I wouldn't stick my neck out for anyone other than myself.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Alive_15_01": "I'll spare your life for now...",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Alive_15_02": "...but you're going to take me to Caramon, and then we'll talk some more.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Alive_03_03": "I knew we'll somehow get along! Follow me.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_FisherBeach_03_01": "We're here. Unfortunately, I really don't know anything more this time. Maybe those fishermen in the nearby settlement will know something.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_FisherBeach_03_02": "You head west, and I'll look along the shore.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_FisherBeach_03_03": "The village is to the east of us, you should be able to find it without a problem. There are only a few fishermen living there, so questioning them all shouldn't be a problem.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_FisherBeach_03_04": "I'll stay here and watch this guy. I'd rather he didn't suddenly get away.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_03_01": "You really want to catch those smugglers. Lorenzo must be paying you pretty well for that, huh?",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Next_03_01": "Kidnapping? I don't think that's anyone's job. It's too much work, and if the buyer changes his mind, it's hard to sell such goods to someone else.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Next_03_02": "Although... one thing comes to mind.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Next_03_03": "Some time ago, I was sitting in Helga's tavern with Finbar and we were celebrating a successful delivery. As is usually the case, as soon as there was a lot of alcohol on the table, more people came down.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Next_03_04": "We were joined by our old friend Willem, with some of his friends. Just as we were about to go back downstairs for another round, some big guy came up to us.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Next_03_05": "I tell you, the guy was as big as a mountain. Suddenly, it was quiet, and he only nodded at one of Willem's friends. That one drank his rum and together they left the tavern.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Next_03_06": "We tried to ask Willem about who it was and what it was about but he didn't really want to say anything about it.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Next_03_07": "He just replied that this friend of his deals with disappearing people and knows the island like no one else.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Next_03_08": "I didn't ask about it more because it wasn't my business, and I preferred not to offend someone who looked like a troll with an axe.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Next_03_09": "Maybe Willem could tell you more, he lives and works on Bermar's farm.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Next_03_10": "Consider this information a gift to celebrate our successful partnership.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_NoGold_15_01": "I don't do it for the money.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_NoGold_15_02": "I'm looking for a certain person and I suspect smugglers may have something to do with his kidnapping.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Brother_15_01": "I'm trying to find my kidnapped brother.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Deal_15_01": "Back to our deal...",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Kill_15_01": "This is where we will end our partnership.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Kill_03_02": "What? Are you crazy? This is not what we agreed!",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Help_15_01": "You've done well. We'll make sure the Guild finds a place for you.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Help_03_02": "Thanks boy, only good things come out of a meeting between two people of business.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Help_03_03": "I'll be hanging around somewhere near your square. Don't forget to mention to Lorenzo that I helped save the life of one of yours!",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Hello_03_01": "We meet again my friend!",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Hello_03_02": "I heard you were back on the matter of my former co-workers, and I thought maybe you could use a little help.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_15_01": "The sooner we get this done the better.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_03_02": "Let me see what they've assigned you.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_03_03": "Hmm... This information is not very accurate...",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_03_04": "But I think I might be able to help you a little bit.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_03_05": "Here, I've marked on the map where you should look.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_Why_15_01": "Why didn't you provide this information earlier?",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_Why_03_02": "Marvin, you know me. You know very well that I prefer to be sparing with facts that may be of considerable value to people I'm talking to.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_Thanks_15_01": "Thanks, this will be very helpful.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_Thanks_03_02": "There's one more thing... I know a place where smugglers often hid 'hot' goods.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_Thanks_03_03": "You know, anything that shouldn't get into the hands of guards under any circumstances. Weapons, weed, and sometimes even ore.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_Thanks_03_04": "I would like to start a new life, open a business and not worry about anything anymore. Such a loot could set me up nicely, as long as the Guild doesn't get its hands on it, of course.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Faster_Thanks_03_05": "I marked this place last on the map, if you're interested, we'll just meet you there.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Ready_15_01": "I'm here. We can go.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Ready_03_02": "Great, I was worried you'd miss this opportunity. I recommend you hold your nose because we're going down into the sewers.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_Ready_03_03": "There was almost always someone sitting by this hiding place, so you better keep your sword at the ready and stay near from me.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q505_Help_15_01": "I'm going on an expedition, I could use a decent weapon.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q505_Help_03_04": "Easy, easy, easy! I have something here that will fit you perfectly. As a thank you for your help.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Ambient_03_04": "I have gold, I have weapons, and my grieving comrades are not around.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Ambient_03_05": "But fate is sometimes fair!",
  "DIA_Pablo_Ambient_03_02": "The people I work for... I mean... I used to work for are a bunch of vindictive sons of bitches.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Ambient_03_03": "I swear they won't let me just walk away.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Ambient_03_01": "My previous... um... colleagues don't just get rid of prisoners. There's a good chance your comrade is still alive.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_AfterQuest_03_01": "Don't you want to buy some equipment?",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_AfterQuest_15_02": "I see you've set yourself up pretty well.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_AfterQuest_03_03": "Relax, it's only temporary. I've got to get rid of all this junk, and then who knows... Maybe I'll sail to Khorinis. I hear there's a fortune to be made there with all that colony stuff.",
  "DIA_Pablo_QA401_AfterQuest_03_04": "If you need anything else, I'll definitely be trapped here for a while.",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_StorageFight_Why_Next_Alive_Choice": "For now, I'll spare your life... (END CONVERSATION)",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Brother_Next_Deal_Kill_Choice": "Our partnership ends here. (Kill)",
  "DIA_Pablo_Q206_ReallyWant_Brother_Next_Deal_Help_Choice": "We'll make sure the Guild finds a place for you."
