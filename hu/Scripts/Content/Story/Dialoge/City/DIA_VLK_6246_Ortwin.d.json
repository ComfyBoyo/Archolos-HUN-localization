  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_01": "Sorry, but I am not taking new orders for sheepskins. Please check back next month.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_15_02": "I come with another matter.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_03": "If you don't want anything from me or my sheep then leave me alone.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_15_04": "Ernesto sent me.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_05": "Heh! Ernesto, you say? What could he want from me?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_15_06": "He said you can't count on a discount at his place.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_07": "What did I do to him?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_15_08": "He's not happy with your man.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_09": "A man? What man of mine?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_15_10": "Don't pretend you don't know what this is about. The herb man you sent him.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_11": "Actually... I remember now. For your information, he wasn't my man...",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_12": "Something wrong with him?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_15_13": "He botched the job and now he's disappeared.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_14": "Well, that's a good one.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_15_15": "Is that all you have to say? Because of you, Ernesto's in a lot of trouble right now.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_16": "Because of me? That's what happens when you commision a job and don't do it yourself!",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_17": "Sometimes you get a smart guy, sometimes you get a con man. It's a risk we have to reckon with.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_18": "As for Ernesto, I will apologize to him personally for this situation.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_15_19": "Where did you hire this guy?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_20": "I remember being in the harbor that day and, to my misfortune, passing near those awful Dark Mysteries.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_21": "I just got accosted by that bastard.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_03_22": "If that's all, forgive me, but I have to get back to work.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Questions_15_01": "Wait, I have a few more questions for you.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Questions_03_02": "Do you understand what caring for animals is? But what am I thinking? You probably have no idea what's on my mind anyway.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Questions_03_03": "A few questions, no more.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_15_01": "What are the Dark Mysteries?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_03_02": "A place where youngsters like you shouldn't go!",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_15_03": "So I guess that's the city's brothel.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_03_04": "Let's leave it at that!",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_15_05": "Why is that? Are you annoyed by the subject of the brothel?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_03_06": "You want to know? Here you go!",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_03_07": "My husband left me for one of those wretches from the Dark Mysteries, do you understand what an insult that is to me?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_15_08": "I'm sorry, I didn't know it was such a sensitive issue...",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_03_09": "Yeah, right... you didn't know.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_15_10": "Back on topic... You better tell me where this place is. Maybe the boy I'm looking for is still out there?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_03_11": "Ugh... Get to the gate in the Merchant District. The one opposite the fire mages' residence.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_DARKSICRETS_03_12": "Go through the gate and walk down towards the harbor until you come to a tavern called Siren's Wail. Dark Mysteries is the nasty building behind the tavern.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Bye_15_01": "Thanks for the information.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Bye_03_02": "Yes, yes.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Visual_15_01": "Do you remember what he looked like?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Visual_03_02": "His hair was tied up in a ponytail.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Visual_15_03": "Why don't you tell me some details?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Visual_03_04": "I'm sorry, but I have no memory for faces.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Visual_03_05": "You won't hear more from me because I have to tend to my sheep.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Visual_03_06": "Have a good day.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Name_15_01": "What was his name?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Name_03_02": "Jef, or something like that.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Name_15_03": "You can't remember your employees' names?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Name_03_04": "I tell you again, it wasn't any of my employees, it was just some stray with a very common name!",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Where_15_01": "Do you know where he might be now?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Where_03_02": "What am I, his babysitter?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_FAQ002_Where_03_03": "Probably someplace where a bunch of freaks like him go and spend their money on booze. It's not hard to find places like that in this city.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_NotNow_03_01": "I think I told you, I'm busy!",
  "DIA_Ortwin_AboutDog_15_01": "Is that your dog?",
  "DIA_Ortwin_AboutDog_03_02": "That old mutt? He's a stray.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_AboutDog_03_03": "He must have once been a herding dog on one of the local farms, which is why he insisted on guarding my sheep.",
  "DIA_Ortwin_AboutDog_03_04": "But you better not go near him - he doesn't trust strangers."
