  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_GoAway_03_05": "Get him!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_03_01": "Did you come here to help us fight the dictates of tyranny?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_03_02": "Or are you simply here to handcuff us and throw us in the dungeon?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_03_03": "Or, as befits a common mercenary, do you want to beat us up and drive us out?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_03_04": "What are you doing here, boy?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Legal_15_01": "Is this gathering even legal?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Legal_03_02": "I might as well ask you if the power you serve was legitimately elected.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Legal_03_03": "I might as well ask you if the thieves you work for are operating legally.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Legal_03_04": "We have a right to be here, just as strangers apparently have a right to settle on our land.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_GoAway_15_01": "Get out of here while I have any patience left.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_GoAway_03_02": "Hahahahahahahahahaha!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_GoAway_03_03": "You are either very brave or very stupid to antagonize the whole crowd.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_GoAway_03_04": "I will venture to say that the second option is true.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Author_15_01": "Let me ask you straight - who is the author of the brochures you distribute around the city?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Author_03_02": "Surely some man of good will.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Tell_15_01": "Tell me where you got them or I'll kick your moldy ass!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Tell_03_02": "I get threats from people every day. Many have already tried to silence us, but the voice of truth still resonates from the squares and marketplaces.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Tell_03_03": "You don't think I'm going to be scared of another growling mutt, do you?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Tell_15_04": "What if this mutt can also bite?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Tell_03_05": "Then it's high time to get rid of his fangs!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Help_15_01": "I came to help you.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Help_03_02": "Are we supposed to believe the city guard? One of our executioners?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Help_03_03": "Sorry, but somehow I find it hard to believe in the selflessness of someone who will do anything for gold.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Help_03_04": "And how do you expect to do that?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Crowd_15_01": "It's better to have an executioner on your side than a mob that can only shout loudly.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Crowd_03_02": "This 'mob' can do more than many bureaucrats.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Crowd_03_03": "I know what the help of bloody Reds is all about! I've seen your 'heart of gold' many times.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Crowd_15_04": "In that case, wait patiently until you hit the scaffold and maybe then you'll remember my offer.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Crowd_03_05": "What... do you propose?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_HelpPoster_15_01": "I could get your brochures to a wider range of citizens.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_HelpPoster_03_02": "There's nothing left to spread.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_HelpPoster_03_03": "Most of them have gone where they were supposed to, and the circulation is going to run out any minute now.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_15_01": "I'm sure we can find a solution. Let's talk.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_03_02": "The time for talk on your part has passed.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_03_03": "It is time for the citizens to speak up.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_03_04": "Good people of Archolos!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_03_05": "Do you believe in sincere help from the city guard?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_03_06": "Do you believe in the help of those who spit, beat and throw your sons and daughters into the dungeon?!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_03_07": "Can you trust the MURDERERS?!!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_03_08": "Do you believe in the help of someone who serves the interests of the merchants?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_03_09": "Do you believe in the help of those who take your last coins?!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_03_10": "Can you trust the THIEVES?!!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_LetsTalk_15_11": "What the hell does that mean?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_New_15_01": "Then it's time to make new ones. The more flyers in circulation, the more people will read them and support your cause.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_New_03_02": "OUR cause.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_New_15_03": "Yeah, that's... that's what I was going to say.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_New_03_04": "You see, it's not that simple.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_New_03_05": "We don't know who the author is, and people aren't wealthy enough to give some scribe or writer a whole wagon of gold just like that.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_FromWhere_03_03": "One day, they just appeared on the streets of the city, and people started passing them from hand to hand over time.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Who_15_01": "Then, where did you get them?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Who_03_03": "The one who made them could not have chosen a better time to distribute them.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Who_03_04": "If you really want to help, tell other people of goodwill that we will be holding a rally outside City Hall against Morris.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Who_03_05": "I expect real crowds in the square.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_15_01": "Your people seem to have taken quite a beating.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_03_02": "You... YOU... THUG! You'll regret this!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_15_03": "Will you go complain to the guards?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_15_04": "Oh, no, wait, I forgot.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_15_05": "My colleagues would sooner throw you in a dungeon than believe your bullshit.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_15_06": "The guards would sooner throw you in a dungeon than lift a finger about a couple of harbor thugs.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_03_07": "You won.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_FromWhere_15_01": "Where did you get the brochures?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_FromWhere_03_02": "I have no idea where from.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_FromWhere_03_04": "All I know is that whoever paid for them must have been pretty damn rich.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Who_15_01": "Who could have made them?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Who_03_02": "It was a large order... beyond the capabilities of an ordinary scribe. No one but Venzel would have taken the job.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Who_15_03": "Venzel?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Who_03_04": "He is the city scribe. You can find him in a guild called 'Three Sailors' near the Guild Trading Post in the Merchant District.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Who_15_05": "That's good enough for me.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Who_03_06": "Does that mean... you will let me go?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Stop_15_01": "I will, but if you don't stop inciting people to riot, we'll talk another way. Is that clear?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Stop_03_02": "S-Sure... I understand... all right.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Stop_03_03": "I'll be quiet as a mouse under a broom!",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_LetGo_15_01": "I'll let you off this time, but be careful - I'll keep an eye on you.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_LetGo_03_02": "Thanks... um... buddy.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Jail_15_01": "You like to talk, huh? That's a good thing.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Jail_15_02": "The Commander will gladly listen to your whining behind bars.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Jail_15_03": "The guards will gladly listen to your whining behind bars.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Jail_15_04": "By the way, maybe they'll give me some gold for my trouble.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Jail_03_05": "M-me? Be-behind bars?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Jail_15_06": "Do you want to discuss it?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_Jail_03_07": "N-no. I will go... I'll go...",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Legal_Choice": "Is this gathering even legal?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Author_Choice": "Who is the author of your brochures?",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Help_Crowd_HelpPoster_Choice": "I could help you hand out brochures.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Help_Crowd_Choice": "It's better than a useless mob.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Help_LetsTalk_Choice": "Let's talk.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_HELLO_Help_Crowd_HelpPoster_New_Choice": "Then it's time to get new ones.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_FromWhere_Who_Stop_Choice": "I will, but I want you to stop inciting people.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_FromWhere_Who_LetGo_Choice": "I'll let you off this time.",
  "DIA_Ludlof_AfterFight_FromWhere_Who_Jail_Choice": "You're coming with me to the dungeon."
