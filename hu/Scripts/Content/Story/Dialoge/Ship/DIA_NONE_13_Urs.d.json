  "DIA_Urs_Q101_Hello_13_02": "My name is Urs and it would be better if you leave me alone.",
  "DIA_Urs_Q101_Hello_13_03": "Surely you have plenty of more interesting things to do than listen to my grievances.",
  "DIA_Urs_Q101_Gods_15_01": "What's bothering you?",
  "DIA_Urs_Q101_Gods_13_02": "Tell me, do you believe in gods?",
  "DIA_Urs_Q101_Gods_15_03": "Are you experiencing a crisis of faith?",
  "DIA_Urs_Q101_Gods_13_04": "Faith is nothing more than a lie repeated over and over by people afraid of the dark.",

  "DIA_Urs_Q101_Ambient_13_01": "Gods are one big lie.",
  "DIA_Urs_Q101_Gods_13_05": "Thank you for listening. It's nice to share concerns with someone sometimes.",
  "DIA_Urs_Q101_Gods_13_06": "Here, it's a little something as a gift. Who knows, you might need it someday. I'm not going to play with magic anymore."
