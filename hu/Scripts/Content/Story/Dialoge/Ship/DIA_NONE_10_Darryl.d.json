  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_WhatsUp_10_01": "Pretty good! As far as I know, we'll reach the island in a little while, and then we'll be safe.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_WhatsUp_10_02": "I'm Darryl, by the way.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_WhatsUp_15_03": "And I'm Marvin.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Calm_15_01": "How do you do it that you're so calm?",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Calm_10_02": "Well, if fate wanted to kill us, it would have had ample opportunity to do so long ago.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Calm_10_03": "Apparently it still favors us though!",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_15_00": "My brother says the same thing.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_10_01": "Smart guy!",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_10_02": "You're lucky to stick together, as I am with Maiwen.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_10_03": "I don't know what I would have done without her. Probably some complete stupidity.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_10_04": "By the way, I saw you come aboard. Looks like we're compatriots.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_15_05": "Are you also coming from Londram?",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_10_06": "Oh, yes! I assume you set out for the same reason we did.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_War_15_00": "As far away from the war as possible.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_War_10_01": "Well, too much risk.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_War_10_02": "Besides, I didn't want to go into the army. I dream of a home, a good job, a family.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_War_10_03": "I'll let my colleagues fight the war, and I'll... I already have something to fight for in life!",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_Uncle_15_00": "Actually, I'm going to visit my uncle.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_Uncle_10_01": "Let me tell you, you picked an interesting time for a family visit!",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_Uncle_15_02": "Not exactly a planned visit.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_Uncle_10_03": "Well, it's always better with family.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Brother_Uncle_10_04": "Once you visit it, I recommend you stay there.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Londram_15_01": "What do you think is the fate of Londram?",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Londram_10_02": "Boy, have you lost your mind? The King doesn't give a damn about us!",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Londram_10_03": "I have a friend in the Army who has connections and knows what's what.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Londram_10_04": "No new contingents have arrived since the Battle of the Eastern Archipelago.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Londram_10_05": "Londram will last a few days... maybe a week, at best.",
  "DIA_Darryl_Q101_Londram_10_06": "Believe me, friend. There's nothing to go back to."
