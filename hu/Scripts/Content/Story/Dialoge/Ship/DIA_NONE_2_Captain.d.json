  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_08_00": "You, baldy! Yeah, I'm talking to you!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_08_01": "You seem like someone who has something in their head.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_08_02": "Grab the rest and get on deck!",
  "TRIA_Jorn_Q101_JornTrialog_01_03": "End of the route?",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_08_04": "Just so you know. It just so happens that every voyage has an end.",
  "TRIA_Marvin_Q101_JornTrialog_15_05": "I thought we would sail to the end of the world and beyond.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_08_06": "By the time we'd sailed to the edge of the world, we'd be devoured by sea monsters or even worse damn things.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_08_07": "Only, what would a mangy land rat like you know about it?",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_15_08": "Your people seem to be very excited about something.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_08_09": "Hey! Look how smart you are! I can see you're the smartest of the bunch of losers.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_08_10": "Patience... You're about to find out for yourself!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_End_08_01": "The island of Archolos is just ahead, but before we reach it, we have some pressing business to attend.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_JornTrialog_End_08_02": "Come on, get up there!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_08_01": "I'm glad, land rats, that you didn't waste too much of my precious time, and you came on deck relatively smoothly.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_08_02": "Being a thoroughly honest man, my crew and I fulfilled our part of the bargain and made it to the designated location.",
  "TRIA_Timo_Q101_TimoTrialog_06_03": "Wait a minute! It's a long way to shore...",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_08_04": "We can't get any closer.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_08_05": "Shoals and razor-sharp rocks are about to start, so even if Beliar himself were to curse me, I won't go any closer.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_08_06": "It's true, according to the bargain, you were supposed to get a jolly boat that would take you safely to shore, but...",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_08_07": "One of you has decided to appropriate your shared payment for this convenience.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_08_08": "Timo, why don't you tell everyone what it was like?",
  "TRIA_Timo_Q101_TimoTrialog_06_09": "Wha...what?! I'm not a thief!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_08_10": "I fed you, gave drinks, took under my wing, and in return I get stabbed by you.",
  "TRIA_Timo_Q101_TimoTrialog_06_11": "But... when I got on the ship, I had it!",
  "TRIA_Timo_Q101_TimoTrialog_06_12": "Someone stole it from me! By Innos, I swear!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_08_13": "Timo, Timo, Timo...",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_08_14": "I wanted to deal with you like two men who value their honor, but since you'd rather insult me, I'll have to resolve things another way.",
  "TRIA_Timo_Q101_TimoTrialog_06_15": "What... what are you doing?!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NoReact_08_01": "I'm paying your debt!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NoReact_08_02": "Die, trash!",
  "TRIA_Marvin_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_15_01": "That won't be necessary!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_02": "Well, look who it is.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_03": "The little rat has just crawled out from under the deck and is already showing his claws!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_04": "You seem like a reasonable kid. You really want to stick your neck out for that piece of trash?",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_05": "Such actions will bring death to you faster than you think, boy.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_06": "I can't let some bastard insult me on my own ship! If you want, you can die for him.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_07": "One this way or another won't make any difference to me!",
  "TRIA_Marvin_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_15_08": "I have no intention of dying for anyone.",
  "TRIA_Marvin_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_15_09": "It just surprises me that you want to waste your energies on a sleazy thief like him.",
  "TRIA_Marvin_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_15_10": "Besides, if I were you, I'd be sorry to dull such a beautiful sword.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_11": "Well, you're right. It's a shame. Plus, I'd be staining the deck with that scumbag's blood...",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_12": "Fortunately, we can easily solve this problem.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_13": "Overboard with him! Let the sea take care of him!",
  "TRIA_Timo_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_06_14": "What?! I... I...",
  "TRIA_Timo_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_06_15": "I've been set up! You bastards!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_16": "Well, now do the same with the others!",
  "TRIA_Jorn_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_01_17": "Wait! We have nothing to do with this!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_18": "Timo was going to pay for all of you. If you have anything valuable with you, give it to me and you'll get a jolly boat.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoTrialog_NotNecessary_08_19": "I thought so!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoIsDown_08_01": "Throw him into the sea.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoIsDown_08_02": "Unfortunately, the world is cruel, and I don't have time to drop you off on dry land.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoIsDown_08_03": "...you must swim!",
  "TRIA_Jorn_Q101_TimoIsDown_01_04": "You lied to us!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoIsDown_08_05": "Oh no, it was your deceased-friend who didn't pay for the transport.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_TimoIsDown_08_06": "I'm a business man, and this 'business' seemed unprofitable to me from the start anyway.",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_End_ToWater_08_01": "Gentlemen! Do the honors!",
  "TRIA_Captain_Q101_End_ToWater_08_02": "Have a nice swim, land rats!"
