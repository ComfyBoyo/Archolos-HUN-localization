  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou_15_01": "Hi, how are you doing?",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou_04_02": "Bad... It's my first time on a ship and I can't handle it anymore!",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou_04_03": "It just keeps rocking and rocking! I feel sick...",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou_04_04": "What if we crash on the rocks and we sink? I can't swim! How will I manage then?",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou2_15_01": "To be honest, I'm a little scared too.",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou2_04_02": "Oh, really? You can't swim either?",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou2_15_03": "I can. It's not that hard. Just swing your arms and legs hard so your head is above the surface.",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou2_15_04": "Oh, and somehow you also have to endure in the water, because it's probably icy.",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou2_04_05": "Great! So not only am I going to drown, but I'm going to be cold too!",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou1_15_01": "It will be alright.",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou1_04_02": "I can see it now! This ship will surely go down and I'll end up in the belly of a sea monster or even worse beast!",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_HowAreYou1_04_03": "You've cheered me up wonderfully, definitely!",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_Father_15_01": "Do you know what your father has planned for you?",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_Father_04_02": "Find me a husband. Nothing unusual, after all, what plans could a father have for his daughter?",
  "DIA_Flora_Q101_Ambient_04_01": "Oh... I'm sick of this journey..."
