  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_01": "What happened here? All those frozen people...",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_02": "Ulryk, why did you do this?! And for so many years I thought of you as a faithful follower of Adanos... You have disgraced yourself and your house!",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_03": "So that's how you managed to defeat my men. Clever. I didn't expect the Prior to let you out of that rock.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_04": "I am sorry if I have disappointed you, Notger. It was the justice that Adanos spoke of that was my main goal.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_05": "He seems to side more strongly with his wise men in blue robes than with those actually wronged and oppressed over the years.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_06": "Shut up already! You committed a coup for your own benefit and ambition. Don't try to justify it.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_07": "Notger, will you be able to help them?",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_08": "I say this with a pained heart, but there is nothing I can do for them.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_09": "There must be some way to defrost them!",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_10": "Defrosting won't be a problem, the thing is, they're no longer with us. They're all dead!",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_11": "Damn it!",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_12": "I'd kill you, right here and now, but I won't stoop to your level.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_13": "You will sail straight to the Valley of Mines and dig ore until every paladin in Myrtana has a great magical weapon.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_03_14": "You yourself will contribute to Rhobar's power and die, working off your debt to the Kingdom.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_Volker_15_01": "We're discussing it here, and the Usurer is running away.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_Volker_03_02": "I realize you want revenge, but I want the Usurer to get to me alive. Do you understand?",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_Volker_03_03": "I'll send my men out to search. Do you have any ideas where he might have gone?",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_Volker_15_04": "I guess there's nothing left for us but to scour the Old Town, maybe he's still here somewhere.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_Volker_03_05": "If he has mercenaries with him, go back for backup, don't try to stop him alone.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_Volker_03_06": "Hopefully he hasn't managed to get too far away yet.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_Yes_15_01": "Understood.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_Yes_03_02": "Hopefully he hasn't managed to get too far away yet.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_No_15_01": "If he resists, I may have no choice.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_No_03_02": "I want the Usurer here alive. End of discussion.",
  "DIA_Notger_Q602_ULRYK_Volker_No_Choice": "If he resists, I may have no choice."
