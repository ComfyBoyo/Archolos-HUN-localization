  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Hello_Volfzacke_03_01": "This place is bigger than you might think. You had a good plan to bring some people and equipment with you.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Hello_Volfzacke_03_02": "You see this place? That's where we'll set up camp. Who knows how long we'll have to stay here. Food, fire and changing of the guard are our priorities.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Hello_Volfzacke_03_03": "Marvin, follow me, we need to clear the area.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSkeletons_03_01": "Those skeletons are so decayed they would break even from a heavy branch. Think of how nice it would be to cut them with a shiny Peacemaker!",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSkeletons_Think_15_01": "You think these are all skeletons?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSkeletons_Think_03_02": "All of them? I can bet the entire ruins are filled with dozens, but maybe within the next few meters, no more danger lurks.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSkeletons_Bridge_15_01": "We should call the others and start transporting our goods.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSkeletons_Bridge_03_02": "Right, the sooner we light a fire and put up guards the better.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterBridge_03_01": "Damn, they were good people...",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterBridge_03_02": "We are being tested really hard, but we can't give up now. We were all prepared that this is how things could go.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterBridge_03_03": "Now it's important that their sacrifice not be in vain. We need to get to the vault and get the Peacemaker as soon as possible. Every minute we're here is an extra minute of danger.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterBridge_03_04": "While the rest were transporting goods, I managed to find some sort of button near one of the statue pedestals. Maybe it's some sort of mechanism to open the bars?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Camp_03_01": "I found you at last! We were able to set up with the gear and finally get to eat something warm.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Camp_03_02": "We need to get back to camp, analyze our situation and plan what to do next. You'll also be able to get at some of our supplies.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Camp_03_03": "Fortunately, not everything fell into the abyss or stayed on the other side.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Camp_LetsGo_15_01": "Let's go.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Camp_No_15_01": "I'll get back to you soon, I'd like to look around a bit more.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Camp_No_03_02": "Whatever you think, but be careful. We can't afford to lose any more people.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_03_01": "As you can see, a city tavern this is not, but I think it will help us get through the next few days we will be spending here.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_03_02": "There's a place to rest and eat something warm. We didn't have time to prepare much more. If you have any ideas what else to put here, talk to the workers.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_03_03": "As long as they have enough materials they will surely prepare it quickly.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_WayOut_15_01": "What about the way back?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_WayOut_03_02": "It will probably take some time to build a crossing that will hold us all. After recent events, no one is going to risk crossing that chasm on just any footbridge.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_WayOut_03_03": "Materials are scarce, so as soon as you find something sturdy call the boys to bring it to camp.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_WhatDo_15_01": "What should I do now?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_WhatDo_03_02": "Have you forgotten already? Our main goal is to find the Peacemaker. Legends tell of it's ability to unite people in even the most passionate of disputes.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_WhatDo_03_03": "Even if it's just a rumor, just finding the sword will surely persuade the superstitious Prior to deal with the subject of the Volker.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_WhatDo_03_04": "We need to investigate this whole place. The Peacemaker must be well hidden. Look around carefully, this place must be swarming with traps.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_Advice_15_01": "Any advice?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_CampReady_Advice_03_02": "There's a reason we've taken so many skilled workers with us. If you come across something you can't handle on your own, you can go back to camp at any time and ask someone for help.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_15_01": "What was that?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_03_02": "You're asking me? We heard shouting and the banging of stones, so we ran immediately towards the camp.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_03_03": "Those cursed stone statues must have just been waiting for a convenient moment to attack!",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_15_04": "Are you sure we didn't wake them up?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_03_05": "Damn them! One thing's for sure, they're tougher than golems and trolls combined. It's a miracle we made it out alive.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_End_03_01": "Go back to the catacombs and find the Peacemaker, I'll catch up with you once we get the situation under control here.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_End_03_02": "One more thing, I've been holding them for a rainy day, maybe it's time to use them.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_What_15_01": "What do we do now?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_What_03_02": "Riordian and I will take care of reorganizing the guys and all the wounded.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_What_03_03": "We can't waste any minute now, another attack could come at any moment.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_Lost_15_01": "How much loss have we suffered?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_Lost_03_02": "In all this confusion, some of ours may have run amok in the tomb. I'll get on with assessing our current situation.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Gargoyle_Lost_03_03": "No need to dwell on the dead now when the sword is so close. Apparently their death is the price of balance.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_03_01": "Marvin, we finally found you! I see you haven't been idle!",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_03_02": "They've accumulated quite a few of these trinkets. Coins, goblets, jewelry...",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_03_03": "I don't see the Peacemaker anywhere. I doubt such an important artifact would just lie buried in a pile of gold.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_MorePpl_03_05": "Meanwhile, allow me to fill my purse with a few gold coins. Don't bother looking for that sword.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_Camp_15_01": "How's the camp situation?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_Camp_03_02": "We managed to calm the others down and set up some barricades at the entrance. The return footbridge was also almost ready when we left.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_Camp_03_03": "We take the sword, return to camp as heroes, and make our way out of this cursed tomb.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_MorePpl_15_01": "Why did you bring Markus and Duster here?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_MorePpl_15_02": "Every pair of hands in camp is needed now.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_MorePpl_03_03": "I had no idea what we would encounter along the way. I preferred not to risk getting stuck behind some heavy door we couldn't open.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_MorePpl_03_04": "Relax, Marvin. I can handle the outdoors. You'll thank me for being here when my arrow saves your life.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_LetsGo_15_01": "There's no more time to waste, let's go.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_LetsGo_03_02": "I like you more and more boy, straight to the point!",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Treasury_LetsGo_03_03": "See that chapel on the other side? The peacemaker must be there.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Sword_15_01": "Is it the Peacemaker?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Sword_03_02": "Do you see him? It's so beautiful... It's been lying here for so many years...",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Sword_03_03": "The power of this artifact can change the fate of our island, and who knows, maybe the entire kingdom.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Sword_03_04": "A sword that, in the right hands, is destined to bring a balance of power and many years of peace.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Sword_03_05": "Marvin, thank you for coming here with me. But this is something I have to do alone.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Sword_WatchOut_15_01": "Be careful who knows how this artifact works.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Sword_WatchOut_03_02": "Relax, we're in the shrine of Adanos. The dangers are behind us.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Sword_Me_15_01": "Maybe I should try it?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Sword_Me_03_02": "This is my destiny. I know you want revenge on the Volker, but there's more to it than that.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_Sword_Me_03_03": "Here it is about walking in the way of Adanos and bringing long-awaited peace.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_15_01": "Are you alive? It looked pretty dangerous...",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_03_02": "I'm alive. I'm fine, Marvin.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_03_03": "I was wrong, I was wrong from the very beginning.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_03_04": "This whole expedition has been one big mistake. I wanted to save this island from bloodshed, but I only contributed to more deaths.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_03_05": "Have I ever really walked the paths of Adanos? Or was I merely seeking revenge and my own glory?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_03_06": "My God has declared me unworthy of his grace. There is no more hope for me.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_GiveUp_15_01": "You want to give up now? We found the Peacemaker.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_GiveUp_03_02": "And we can't hold him! It's like we didn't find him at all!",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Good_15_01": "The motives were personal, but you wanted to do something good for everyone.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Good_03_02": "I don't know anymore, Marvin. Ever since that damn Volker slaughtered my people, it feels like I'm living in a dream.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Good_03_03": "My whole world has turned upside down. I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Volker_15_01": "You promised me revenge on the Volker, have you forgotten?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Volker_03_02": "This battle, however, you will have to fight alone. Forgive me, my friend.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Volker_03_03": "When you get him, and I know you will eventually get him, and you will pierce his heart with your blade, then greet him also from me and my people.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Volker_03_04": "Let him experience what he has done for all of us.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Try_15_01": "Why don't I try to wield the Peacemaker?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Try_03_02": "Believe me, it's not a pleasant feeling. I have devoted my entire life to serving Adanos, and look how I was treated.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Try_03_03": "However, if you are willing to risk your life, go ahead and try it.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Leave_15_01": "Enough of this, let's get the Peacemaker and get out of here.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Leave_03_02": "Take this sword that so many of our people have died for and deliver it to the Water Mages at the monastery.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Leave_03_03": "We can't wield it, but maybe there's a small chance that all that sacrifice wasn't in vain.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Leave_03_04": "Don't mind me, I have to stay here for a while. I'll gather my strength, think things over... and catch up you later.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Goodbye_03_01": "Goodbye, my friend.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Goodbye_03_02": "And... Good luck.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Yes_15_01": "If that is your wish.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_No_15_01": "Remember when you got me out of that Volker's warehouse? Or the time you rescued me later at the waterfall above Silbach?",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_No_15_02": "I can't leave you here like this.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_No_03_03": "Marvin, you're a good guy, but you have to understand that you can't save everyone.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_No_03_04": "I realized it too late. Sometimes we go so far in our search that we lose ourselves.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_No_03_05": "I just need to rest for a while. I'm tired from all this fighting. All these years I've been fighting...",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_No_03_06": "But whether... but whether your fight is over or has just begun is for you to decide.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_No_03_07": "Take this as a reminder of our struggles together.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_WaitASec_15_01": "I'll be right back.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_WaitASec_03_02": "Don't worry, I'm not in a hurry.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_TrySword_03_01": "I told you, you're lucky to be alive at all.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_TrySword_03_02": "I have no idea who would be worthy to wield that sword. Perhaps it would be better if it remained here, never to be found.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_OpenGate_03_01": "Excellent! I knew you could handle it!",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_OpenGate_03_02": "Find out what's deeper in these ruins, but don't go too far. Above all, try to light up the area, it's dark as a molerat's ass here.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_OpenGate_03_03": "I will help control our people and join you.",
  "DIA_Kessel_VZ_Ambient_03_03": "Damn, what are those damned beasts of stone...in these ruins, I think everything's out to get us.",
  "DIA_Kessel_VZ_Ambient_03_02": "Here at camp you can at least get a brief respite from the terrifying darkness of this place. Taking all this gear was a good plan!",
  "DIA_Kessel_VZ_Ambient_03_01": "This place is huge, but I know Adanos will lead us to our destination.",
  "DIA_Kessel_VZ_CanYouTeach_03_01": "So it looks like I'm going to have to make sure you know how to deal with anything that might be waiting for us in these ruins.",
  "DIA_Kessel_VZ_CanYouTeach_03_02": "Since you already belong to the Ring Of Water, I can show you some of our secret moves.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Leave_Choice": "Let's get the Peacemaker and get out of here. (LEAVE THE CHAPEL)",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Good_Choice": "You wanted to do something good for everyone.",
  "DIA_Kessel_Q514_AfterSword_Leave_No_Choice": "I'm not leaving you here."
