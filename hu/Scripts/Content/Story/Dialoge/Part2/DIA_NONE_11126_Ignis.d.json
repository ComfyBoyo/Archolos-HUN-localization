  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_02": "Do you think it's him?",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_03": "Yes! Of course it's him!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_04": "The description matches.",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_05": "Interesting... Doesn't look threatening...",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_06": "As they say...",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_07": "You don't judge a book by its author.",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_08": "By its cover.",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_09": "What?",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_10": "You don't judge a book by its cover, fool. The author has nothing to do with it.",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_11": "You're a fool!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_12": "All right, calm down!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_13": "Listen, kid!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_14": "Fortune smiled on us, we earned a lot of gold recently.",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_15": "Meanwhile, our current assignment seems to be somewhat...",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_16": "Shady?",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_17": "Average?",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_18": "Shitty?",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_19": "Silence!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_20": "Ehm... Listen, it's unfortunate, but we got an order for your head.",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_21": "But it can be solved in another way! A symbolic amount, thousand gold pieces, and you're free and clear. What do you say, kid?",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_22": "Thousand gold pieces? How do you divide that into four?",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_23": "It's easy!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_24": "Ignis takes five hundred, I take three hundred, and you each take a hundred!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_25": "I don't think that's entirely fair.",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_26": "One hundred gold pieces will be easier to divide!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_27": "Oh gods...",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_28": "All right! A hundred gold pieces, for beer!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_03_29": "What do you say, kid?",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_Gold_15_01": "Drink for my good health!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_Gold_03_02": "Thanks, kid!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_Gold_03_03": "And you drink for ours!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_Gold_03_04": "And if anything...",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_Gold_03_05": "You didn't see us, and we didn't see you!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_BadTime_15_01": "Enough with those games!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_BadTime_15_02": "Draw your weapons!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_BadTime_03_03": "Oh, kid...",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_BadTime_03_04": "You don't want to get along, so...",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_BadTime_03_05": "...you'll be dead!",
  "DIA_Ignis_EasterEgg_03_06": "I followed the darkness step by step, alone, until it showed me its face.",
  "DIA_Ignis_EasterEgg_03_07": "And fear rose in my heart when I saw it.",
  "DIA_Ignis_EasterEgg_03_08": "To the light I went and there I shall remain until the hour of the final battle is at hand.",
  "DIA_Ignis_EasterEgg_03_09": "Now that it is coming, I will move into the darkness and defeat it. I will not be afraid.",
  "DIA_Ignis_EasterEgg_03_10": "I will bring light to the darkness. I myself go where no man has gone before.",
  "DIA_Ignis_EasterEgg_15_11": "What was that?",
  "DIA_Ignis_EasterEgg_03_12": "My poem.",
  "DIA_Ignis_EasterEgg_03_13": "I hope to complete it at some point.",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_NoGold_03_02": "Whoa, poor guy with no gold?",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_NoGold_03_03": "It's a shame to beat a guy like that!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_NoGold_03_04": "All right, disappear before I change my mind!",
  "DIA_Ignis_HuntersTrialog_Gold_Choice": "Drink for my health! (Give 100 GP)"
