  "DIA_Lathi_Net_15_01": "Can you fix nets?",
  "DIA_Lathi_Net_03_02": "Well, I rarely get a chance to do that because I fish with a rod, but once I get my hands on one, I don't let go until it's in better condition than it was originally!",
  "DIA_Lathi_Net_15_03": "And what about one with hooks, could you do it?",
  "DIA_Lathi_Net_03_04": "Oh, how beautiful! But... what could have destroyed such an intricate work?",
  "DIA_Lathi_Net_15_05": "Don't fall in love. How much do you charge to fix something like that?",
  "DIA_Lathi_Net_03_06": "Man, I should be paying you for the opportunity to interact with something like this! Wait, it'll be ready for use soon!",
  "DIA_Lathi_Net_03_07": "Here, it's fixed!",
  "DIA_Lathi_Net_03_08": "Make good use of it, it's really high quality equipment!",
  "DIA_Lathi_Net_15_09": "Of course, I will remember that. Thanks for your help.",
  "DIA_Lathi_Net_03_10": "No problem.",
  "DIA_Lathi_Hello_03_01": "I am a fisherman, and one with a monopoly on the fish that swim in this stream. And by the way, my name is Lathi.",
  "DIA_Lathi_Ambient_03_01": "The fish are taking, people from the city are eager to buy them, everything is as it should be.",
  "DIA_Lathi_Ambient_03_02": "All right. If you ever have another net to fix, feel free, I'm not going anywhere.",
  "DIA_Lathi_Ambient_03_03": "The island is getting more and more dangerous. I'm slowly beginning to think about moving within the walls."
