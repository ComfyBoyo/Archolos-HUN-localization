  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_VineyardAttack_03_02": "It's a nightmare! The argument between the workers grew to the point where they jumped at each other's throats.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_VineyardAttack_15_03": "I thought you had everything under control!",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_VineyardAttack_03_04": "I thought so. The man I sent out thought so too, and now he lies among the corpses of other vineyard workers.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_VineyardAttack_15_05": "So what do we do?",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_VineyardAttack_03_06": "I see only one solution. We must get rid of all those who remain on Holdwig's side... and finish him off.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_VineyardAttack_15_07": "Andreas said not to kill him.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_VineyardAttack_03_08": "What else is left? As long as he lives, he'll keep trying to get the vineyard back. Anyway, this is no time for discussion!",

  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_03_01": "The vineyard belongs to us. You'll just have to calm down only those below before they kill each other.",

  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_OtherWay_03_02": "The other way? The judge will hold him in a cell and let him out, and then our problems will come back again.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Letter_15_01": "I need you explain something to me first.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Letter_15_02": "Did you really order some Harry to poison Holdwig?",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Letter_03_03": "Wait... Where did you get this? Give it back! It's not meant for you!",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Letter_15_04": "Andreas was supposed to get the vineyard back because he was cheated, yet you planned to kill him from the start.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Letter_03_05": "I've told you this before and I'll tell you again now: getting rid of Holdwig is the only way to solve the problem once and for all!",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Colony_15_01": "Well, it might not be so easy getting out of jail now.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Colony_03_02": "I don't think I'm keeping up...",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Colony_15_03": "Colony, does that tell you anything?",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Colony_03_04": "Actually...",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Colony_03_05": "That way we get rid of one without risking the revenge of the other, brilliant! Let's get to work!",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Gold_15_01": "Kill him, but my silence will cost you.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Gold_03_02": "Finally, you speak the way I like. How much?",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_500_15_01": "500 gold pieces.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_500_03_02": "Then it's a deal.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_1000_15_01": "1000 gold pieces.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_1000_03_02": "I can't give that much, suggest something more reasonable.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_OtherWay_Choice": "There must be some other way.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_OtherWay_Colony_Choice": "It may not be so easy to get out of the colony.",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Letter_Choice": "You have to explain something to me first! (Show letter)",
  "DIA_Gerhard_SQ225_HoldwigFinish_Nothing_Choice": "(Don't react)",
