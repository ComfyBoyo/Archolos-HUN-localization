  "DIA_Zacky_WhatareYouDoingHere_15_01": "What are you doing here?",
  "DIA_Zacky_WhatareYouDoingHere_03_02": "Among other things, I perform failed experiments with golems.",
  "DIA_Zacky_WhatareYouDoingHere_03_03": "And between you and me, I also trade summoning scrolls... If you're interested, you're welcome.",
  "DIA_Zacky_ScrollsTrade_15_01": "Let me see those scrolls.",
  "DIA_Zacky_AboutCaspar_15_01": "Did you hear about what was going on in the nearby cemetery?",
  "DIA_Zacky_AboutCaspar_03_02": "And should I?",
  "DIA_Zacky_AboutCaspar_15_03": "One of the novices practiced magic there.",

  "DIA_Zacky_AboutCaspar_15_08": "You sell the scrolls, he used them...",
  "DIA_Zacky_AboutCaspar_03_09": "Hyh... What are you suggesting? You can't prove anything!",
  "DIA_Zacky_AboutCaspar_03_10": "Scrolls are scattered all over the monastery, and magic was, is, and will be dangerous!",
  "DIA_Zacky_AboutCaspar_03_11": "Let's dispense with this nonsense. Either we trade in friendship or we don't trade at all.",
  "DIA_Zacky_Ambient_03_01": "Everything's fine with me. People are eager for my scrolls, I don't have much work to do. Life in the monastery is not as bad as some people think.",
  "DIA_Zacky_Ambient_03_02": "Aha... Not bad. If you want to talk about that unpleasant incident again, you can leave it alone."
