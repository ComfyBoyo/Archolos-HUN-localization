  "DIA_Stefan_Q501_TakeCauldron_03_02": "Absolutely not! I need it to make soup!",
  "DIA_Stefan_Q501_TakeCauldron_03_03": "You probably want to cook some extract in it, you can forget it! After that, you won't be able to cook anything edible in such a cauldron.",
  "DIA_Stefan_Q501_TakeCauldron_03_04": "I've had enough problems with rats. Now some unfulfilled alchemist is going to bother me...",
  "DIA_Stefan_Q501_Rats_15_01": "I'll get rid of those rats in exchange for a cauldron.",
  "DIA_Stefan_Q501_Rats_03_02": "Are you crazy? If you go at them with a stick, they'll hide in their burrows. Just the thought of them crawling between the walls sickens me.",
  "DIA_Stefan_Q501_Rats_15_03": "How about some poison?",
  "DIA_Stefan_Q501_Rats_03_04": "You must be really crazy! Poison in the kitchen? You want everyone to get poisoned?",

  "DIA_Stefan_HowDidYouGetHere_03_03": "I was assigned duties in the kitchen after I confessed to one of the mages that I could cook. I've spent most of my time here ever since.",
  "DIA_Stefan_Ambient_03_01": "Everything's fine. Eh... Cooking is much more fun than cleaning all those buildings.",
