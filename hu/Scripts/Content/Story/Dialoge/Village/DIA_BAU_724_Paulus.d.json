  "DIA_Paulus_Canyoutrain_13_02": "You? I'm supposed to train villagers, not strangers. Find someone else.",
  "DIA_Paulus_Canyoutrain_15_03": "I'm sure there's something that will change your mind.",
  "DIA_Paulus_Canyoutrain_13_04": "Yes, gold. There's never enough of it. If you bring me some, we'll talk about your training.",
  "DIA_Paulus_Goldfortrain_Description": "Is that enough? (Pay 10 GP)",
  "DIA_Paulus_Goldfortrain_15_01": "Is that enough?",
  "DIA_Paulus_Goldfortrain_13_01": "What?! For that kind of money? Don't make me laugh!",
  "DIA_Paulus_Goldfortrain_13_02": "Yes, that's a reasonable amount. I can now break Albyn's command and show you something. Just remember, each lesson will cost too!",
  "DIA_Paulus_Goldfortrain_15_03": "I might have expected that.",

  "DIA_Paulus_Ambient_13_01": "Don't bother me, I have important responsibilities on my mind.",
  "DIA_Paulus_Ambient_13_02": "Okay. Remember to keep improving your skills. Orcs will show you no mercy, you must be prepared to fight them!",
  "DIA_Paulus_Ambient_13_03": "It would be great if everyone I teach was capable as you. I hope some teacher more experienced than me will take care of your development."
