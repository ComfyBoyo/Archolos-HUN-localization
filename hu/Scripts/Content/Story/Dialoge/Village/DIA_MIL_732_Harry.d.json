  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_03_00": "Who's out there wandering around at night? Answer me, quick!",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_03_00": "What are you looking for in Silbach?",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_City_15_00": "We come from the city.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_City_03_00": "By the looks of you, you don't look a damn thing like city folk to me!",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_City_Road_15_00": "We veered slightly off the path.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_City_Road_03_00": "'Slightly' is an understatement!",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_City_Road_03_01": "If my memory serves me correctly, the city of Archolos lies to the north of here, and you came from the direction of the Lurker Coast...",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_City_Storm_15_00": "We got lost in that storm.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_City_Storm_03_00": "That's interesting, because the road from the city to the village goes straight as a crow flies!",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Londram_15_00": "We come from Londram.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Londram_03_00": "And how did you get across the sea? By swimming?",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Londram_03_01": "I didn't see any ship!",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Londram_Fishers_15_00": "We took off on a fishing boat.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Londram_Fishers_03_00": "And since when do fishermen go so far out to sea?",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Londram_Fishers_15_01": "How should I know? There was an opportunity, so we took it.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Londram_Fishers_03_01": "Something tells me the guards will certainly take an interest in you.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Londram_Merchants_15_00": "A merchant frigate disembarked us on the west side of the island.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Londram_Merchants_03_00": "And that's very interesting, because as far as I know, the royal army has requisitioned almost all the ships.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Londram_Merchants_03_01": "Well, it looks like this one was an exception.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Outlanders_15_00": "We are just simple wanderers.",
  "DIA_Harry_GateJorn_Outlanders_03_00": "Wanderers? Good grief! You look like mere vagrants, not 'wanderers'!",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_pub_03_01": "It would be best if you went straight to the local inn.",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_03_01": "Okay, let's recap...",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_03_02": "There's something about your story that doesn't add up.",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_03_03": "Talk to me from the beginning, only this time bluntly!",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_03_04": "What you say sounds plausible...",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_03_05": "All right, you don't have to stand here. You can come in.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_exhausted_15_00": "We are exhausted, wounded and hungry. We seek shelter.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_exhausted_03_01": "Indeed, you look like the seven woes...",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_exhausted_03_02": "Like most beggars and freeloaders who make life miserable for decent people!",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_exhausted_03_03": "I let them in once before, and I regretted it bitterly!",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_war_15_00": "We're running away from the war.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_war_03_01": "Really?",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_war_03_02": "There is no war on Archolos. Well, unless you brought it with you!",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_war_15_03": "Sure, you can disbelieve me. The question is whether you can afford not to believe me.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_war_03_04": "It remains to be seen if you are telling the truth!",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_brother_15_00": "My brother's hurt. Someone needs to get him fixed up fast!",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_brother_03_01": "I see he's a tough guy, and the city is not far away.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_brother_03_02": "To my eye, it will hold.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_bully_15_00": "Listen to me! Either you'll let us through, or your snapping face will end up in this mud!",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_bully_03_01": "Your insults don't impress me, you little brat. If I drop a hair from my head, there'll be a dozen guards here to chase you out in a jiffy!",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_help_15_00": "We will repay you for your help.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_help_03_01": "How much?",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_help_15_02": "Now I don't have anything on me, but we can work it off.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_help_03_03": "Well, actually... not a bad idea...",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_help_03_04": "After the recent flooding, Albyn would certainly have more than one job for you.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_woundedcompanion_15_00": "We were attacked by wild beasts. We have a wounded comrade.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_woundedcompanion_03_01": "Only a complete idiot would be walking through the wilderness at this hour.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_woundedcompanion_03_02": "Besides, he might as well have tripped on a straight road and you made up a story about it.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_place_15_00": "We're just passing through. We are looking for a place to rest.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_place_03_01": "And does our village look like an inn for beggars?",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_place_03_02": "If you're looking for a place to drink booze, head to town.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_place_03_03": "There are only decent people living in Silbach!",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_thanks_15_00": "Thanks for your help.",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_thanks_03_01": "Yeah... I'll be watching you, you can rest assured.",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_thanks_03_02": "And no snooping around! It's nighttime and people are already snoring! Do we understand each other?",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_thanks_15_03": "Sure thing.",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_thanks_03_04": "I'm gonna get in trouble for this...",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_where_15_00": "Where exactly is the inn?",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_where_03_01": "Go straight up the hill, then right and bridge over the river. It's a big building, you definitely won't miss it.",
  "DIA_Harry_insum_where_03_02": "You can stop there, but don't count on a nice welcome. People are up to their ears in problems.",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_15_01": "Has Jorn passed by here lately?",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_03_02": "Who's that?",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_15_03": "A guy about my height, bald but a little more muscular. You met him some time ago when he arrived in the village at night with the rest of my companions.",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_15_04": "A guy about my height, bald but a bit more muscular. You met him some time ago when we arrived in the village with the rest of our companions.",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_03_05": "No, I haven't seen that vagrant around here.",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_03_06": "Go bother someone else.",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_See_15_01": "Are you sure you didn't see him? He was seriously ill, couldn't have gone far.",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_See_03_02": "Are you deaf? No one was here, and certainly none of you!",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_See_03_03": "And if he was sick, maybe he's been in a ditch for a long time. I'd look for him there if I were you!",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_Kurt_15_01": "Have you heard anything about Kurt's break-in?",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_Kurt_03_02": "I've heard about it, and I think I can guess whose work it is.",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_Kurt_15_03": "Whose?",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_Kurt_03_04": "Yours, of course!",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_Kurt_03_05": "Not only did the good man take you under his roof, but he got such a thank you!",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_Bye_15_01": "In that case, I'll look for him somewhere else.",
  "DIA_Harry_Boring_03_01": "Don't you have anything to do but bother me?",
  "DIA_Harry_Boring_Gate_15_01": "What are you doing so far from the gate?",
  "DIA_Harry_Boring_Gate_03_02": "I'm checking to make sure employees aren't slacking off on the job, why?",
  "DIA_Harry_Boring_Gate_03_03": "Anyway, what am I going to explain to you? Mind your own business, outsider!",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_03_01": "Stop! What are you holding there?",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_03_02": "Give it to me!",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_03_03": "What kind of crap are you selling people?",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_15_04": "Ordinary tobacco.",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_03_05": "From what I can see, it's not that ordinary at all!",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_03_06": "Albyn will find out about everything, you can be sure of that!",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_15_07": "It's nothing. I'm just talking to them.",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_03_08": "Just talking, huh? I'll bet you were giving them something there!",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_Albyn_15_01": "Maybe Albyn should find out about you leaving the gate unguarded and disturbing the farmers at work?",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_Albyn_03_02": "Talk all you want, outsider.",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_Albyn_15_03": "I think when he finds out about it, he'll shower you with gold for your solid work.",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_Albyn_03_04": "We'll talk again, smart guy...",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_15_01": "Ezekiel's daughter stayed on shore.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_02": "And?",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_15_03": "I need someone to bring her body back to the village.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_04": "What's it to me?",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_Guard_15_01": "You are a guard of this village, so it is your duty to...",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_Guard_03_02": "To help the VILLAGERS. You are not them, so I have no obligation to do so.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_Adanos_15_01": "Adanos would help his children in need.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_Adanos_03_02": "Or he would drown them if he had the whim.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_Adanos_03_03": "Your religious rants don't impress me. Leave them to those smarter than you.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_Gold_15_01": "What do you want in return for your help? Money?",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_Gold_03_02": "As they say, money doesn't stink.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_Gold_03_03": "For a hefty purse, I'm willing to go there.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_YourGold_Description": "(Donate 25 GP in exchange for helping Ezekiel)",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_YourGold_03_01": "Even though you look like a bum you still have some gold on you.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_YourGold_03_02": "So what do I do?",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_YourGold_15_03": "You will take Ezekiel to the coast and together with the other guard take his daughter's body to the cemetery.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_YourGold_03_04": "It doesn't sound pleasant, but like I said. Money doesn't stink.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_YourGold_03_05": "Send that Ezekiel when he's ready.",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_03_01": "You're Marvin, right?",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_Yes_15_01": "Yes, it's me. Has Jorn been here yet?",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_Yes_03_02": "There's been a wounded man here recently. Viktor told me more of you might be coming.",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_Yes_03_03": "Is it just you and your friend? The rest are lost in the woods?",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_Yes_15_04": "They stayed behind, we just cleared a path. They should be here soon.",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_Yes_03_05": "Great, even more freeloaders.",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_Yes_03_06": "Get inside. Viktor has vouched for you, so don't even think about causing trouble in the village.",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_Where_15_01": "Where can I find Jorn and this Viktor?",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_Where_03_02": "Continue on this path, when you come to a fork, turn right towards the river. When you pass the bridge you will have Bastian's inn on your left.",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_Where_03_03": "Viktor is one of the employees there and that's where your brother is resting.",
  "DIA_Harry_Q102_FabioChosen_Where_03_04": "Now get lost, I've got more interesting things to do than chat with strangers.",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_Bukhard_15_01": "I hear you've been talking to a royal scout.",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_Bukhard_03_02": "Yeah, but when was it... Why do you ask?",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_Search_15_01": "I'm looking for him. Do you still remember what you talked about?",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_Search_03_02": "He inquired a bit about the area, the swamps south of the village, and the mood of the villagers in general.",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_Search_03_03": "From what I remember, he was looking for some sort of guide to the less frequented areas of the village.",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_Search_03_04": "No one in the village was too fond of him, but he managed to find some hunters who promised to help him.",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_Search_Hunters_15_01": "Were they local hunters?",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_Search_Hunters_03_02": "No, I don't really know them. They appeared in the area a few months ago, they only come to the village to replenish supplies and sometimes sell some flimsy trophies.",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_Search_Hunters_03_03": "You know what, you're damn lucky today, I think they're just coming back from a hunt. Best if you ask them yourself for the details.",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_03_05": "What the hell is wrong with them all of a sudden?!",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_15_01": "Your friends tried to kill me!",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_03_02": "What? What are you talking about?",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_15_03": "As soon as we were away from the gate, they pulled out their weapons!",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_03_04": "I swear I had no idea about that at all!",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_Belive_15_01": "Okay, I believe you.",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_Belive_03_02": "Thanks, man! Albyn would kill me if he found out we had any dealings with these scummy types...",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_Draw_03_01": "Dude, please, you gotta believe me... I had nothing to do with this!",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_Knew_15_01": "I knew these people. They're the scum of Scoundrels' Haven. They deal in kidnapping and murder.",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_Knew_03_02": "And to think that they just walked into the village and claimed to be ordinary hunters...",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_Knew_03_03": "I'm gonna have to be more careful who I let in here. Thanks for the help, man.",
  "DIA_Harry_Silbach_place_Choice": "We're just passing through.",
  "DIA_Harry_SQ118_NeedHelp_Guard_Choice": "You are, after all, a sentry of this village.",
  "DIA_Harry_WhereIsJorn_See_Choice": "Are you sure you haven't seen him?",
  "DIA_Harry_Busted_Albyn_Choice": "I'll tell Albyn you left your post.",
  "DIA_Harry_KQ405_AfterHunters_Knew_Choice": "I knew these people."
