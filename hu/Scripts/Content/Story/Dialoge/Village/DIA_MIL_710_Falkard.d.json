{
  "DIA_Folkard_Burglary_15_02": "What happened here?",
  "DIA_Folkard_Burglary_03_03": "As far as I know, there was a break-in, but I don't know the details.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_15_01": "Can I ask you a few questions?",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_03_02": "Usually I'm the one questioning others, but go ahead. What do you want to know?",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_whatuknow_15_01": "What do you know about this break-in?",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_whatuknow_03_02": "Not much more than you, I assume. I only came here after Viktor called me.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_whatuknow_03_03": "Talk to him. Maybe he'll have something more to say about it.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_15_03": "Thanks for the information.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_15_01": "Have you seen a bald, muscular guy lately? His name is Jorn.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_03_02": "The name doesn't tell me much, but I think I saw him with you as you walked down the road toward the vineyard.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_03_03": "Why do you ask?",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_15_04": "It's my brother. I came to the village with him recently.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_15_05": "At the time of the break-in he was staying at the hut of Kurt, our uncle, and all indications are that he was kidnapped.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_03_06": "Kidnapped? Sounds pretty unlikely.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_15_07": "I also find it hard to believe, but the facts speak for themselves.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_03_08": "I wouldn't jump to conclusions if I were you.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_03_09": "I can promise you that I will let you know if I find out anything about your brother.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_03_10": "However, if there is indeed a kidnapping, I'm afraid only the city guard can help.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_03_01": "Are you new here? Last time you ran through here with your friend, you were so drunk I couldn't get anything from you.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_03_02": "You're lucky I saw you leaving the village, because I would never have let you back in.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_03_03": "Are you new here? I don't think I've seen you here before.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_MyNameIsMarvin_15_01": "My name is Marvin and I recently arrived on the island.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_MyNameIsMarvin_03_02": "I'm Folkard.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_MyNameIsMarvin_03_03": "By the way, you picked a bad time to travel.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_MyNameIsMarvin_15_04": "I've had time to figure it out, but I didn't have much choice.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_MyNameIsMarvin_03_05": "Are you running away from the war?",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_MyNameIsMarvin_15_06": "You guessed it.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_MyNameIsMarvin_03_07": "Like most newcomers lately, but I don't blame you at all.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_MyNameIsMarvin_03_08": "These are troubled times and not everyone is willing to die for the King.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_PissOff_15_01": "It's none of your business who I am or what I'm doing here.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_PissOff_03_02": "Suit yourself, but you won't get far with that attitude.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_PissOff_03_03": "I'm not gonna stop you.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_Suprised_15_01": "Don't you want to punch me, call me names and spit on me?",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_Suprised_03_02": "And why would I do that?",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_Suprised_15_03": "It seemed to me that no one here liked strangers.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Hello_Suprised_03_04": "If that were the case, I would have to give myself a slap in the face in the first place.",
  "DIA_Folkard_YourWork_15_01": "What do you do here?",
  "DIA_Folkard_YourWork_03_02": "I make sure wild animals and uninvited guests stay away from the village.",
  "DIA_Folkard_YourWork_03_03": "Since my replacement, Rolf, went missing in the storm, I've had my hands full.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_StartQuest_15_01": "Maybe I could check out what's going on with him.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_StartQuest_03_02": "Would you really do that for me?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_CancelQuest_15_01": "I don't have time for this.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_CancelQuest_03_02": "Too bad. I hope he finds himself whole and healthy.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_CancelQuest_03_03": "In any case, good luck!",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_WithoutGold_15_01": "Why not? I can try.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_WithoutGold_03_02": "Do you have anything to defend yourself with?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_WithoutGold_15_03": "Defend?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_WithoutGold_03_04": "The surroundings of Silbach are not safe. It is full of wild animals, so it is worth having even the simplest mace to defend yourself.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_WithGold_15_01": "For the right payment...",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_WithGold_03_02": "Yeah, sure. You get half my pay.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_INeedSword_15_01": "Something would come in handy.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_INeedSword_03_02": "Take this sword. It may not be a quality weapon, but it'll kill a molerat or a scavenger.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_INeedSword_15_03": "Thanks.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_IAmGood_15_01": "I already have my weapon with me.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_IAmGood_03_02": "That's fine, but if you need any weapons, let me know.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_NeedThatSword_15_01": "I think I could use a weapon of some sort though.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_15_01": "Rolf is safe now.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_03_02": "Thank you. What a relief.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_03_04": "Were there any problems?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_WolfsAttack_15_01": "A couple of wolves, but we dealt with them somehow.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_WolfsAttack_03_02": "Wolves? This close to the village walls? We'll have to call the hunters...",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_WolfsAttack_03_03": "These animals are no slouches.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_Finish_15_01": "I managed to retrieve some supplies from the fishing boat.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_Finish_03_02": "Well done. I didn't think anything survived that storm.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_Finish_03_03": "Take these few coins. It's the least I can give you for your trouble.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_EasyQuest_15_01": "Well, that was easy.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_EasyQuest_03_02": "Since you're such a fighter, why don't you consider joining the sentries, huh?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_EasyQuest_03_03": "We could use someone like you.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_EasyQuest_15_04": "Thanks, but I have slightly different plans for now.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_EasyQuest_03_05": "Suit yourself, but I'll stand up for you if you change your mind.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_Finish_TakeGold_15_01": "Thanks, they'll come in handy.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_Finish_TakeGold_03_02": "I thank you on behalf of myself and Rolf.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_FoundRolf_Finish_TakeGold_03_03": "Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to work.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_RolfDead_03_01": "You're back. What did you find out?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_RolfDead_15_02": "Rolf is dead. Looks like I was too late.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_RolfDead_03_03": "Damn... how did he die?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_RolfDead_15_06": "Not very nice. The wolves made dinner out of him.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_RolfDead_03_07": "Too bad. I shouldn't have let him go alone in the first place.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_RolfDead_03_08": "Anyway, thanks for the info.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Finish_NoThanks_15_01": "Give them to Rolf's family. I'm sure they'll need them more now.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Finish_NoThanks_03_02": "That's noble of you. I will.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_RolfDead_15_04": "Rolf is dead. He died on the way to the village.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_RolfDead_03_05": "Damn...",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_15_01": "I need your help.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_02": "What is it?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_15_03": "Ezekiel needs help with bringing back his daughter's body.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_04": "In fact, you brought in Rolf.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_05": "He's a little fearful, but if anything, there's always Markus around. They should be able to handle it.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_06": "I wish I could help you, but I can't. Someone has to guard the gate. I'm sorry.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_15_07": "Maybe I could look for someone to replace you?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_08": "Actually, Markus could help you. He's always around anyway.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_09": "Talk to him. Maybe he'll agree.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_10": "You managed to find a replacement for me.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_11": "There's nothing left for me to do but help Ezekiel. Have him report back when he's ready to hit the beach.",
  "DIA_Folkard_OthSheep_15_01": "Haven't you seen a sheep somewhere lately?",
  "DIA_Folkard_OthSheep_03_02": "The whole flock and quite often. Otho walks his sheep this way for longer grazing trips towards the river.",
  "DIA_Folkard_OthSheep_15_03": "I was more referring to the single lost piece.",
  "DIA_Folkard_OthSheep_03_04": "No.. I don't recall any, but maybe hunter Markus saw something. He spends most of his time at his camp southwest of here.",
  "DIA_Folkard_OthSheep_15_05": "Thanks for your help.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Train_03_02": "I wonder if you wouldn't prefer to use a decent weapon instead of stick that can't even pierce a lurker skin.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Train_03_03": "I guarantee I won't take more than Paulus for lessons, and as for learning how to use heavy weapons, it's really not much!",
  "DIA_Folkard_Teach_15_00": "Let's start training.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Teach_03_01": "Let's get to work!",
  "DIA_Folkard_Teach_03_02": "You're too good, I can't teach you any more.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Teach_2H1_03_01": "That's a little low, bring more gold.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Teach_2H5_03_01": "We're agreed on a specific amount, remember?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Start_15_01": "Your replacement is missing?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Start_03_02": "He insisted on checking to see if there were any supplies left near the old fishing boat. With these damn floods, every barrel of wine or fish is at a premium.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Start_03_03": "There's been no sign of him since yesterday. I would go looking for him, but Albyn wouldn't let me leave the village now.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_TakeQuest_15_01": "I'll look for your replacement.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Questions_Description": "I have a couple of questions.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Questions_Boat_15_01": "Where is this boat?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Questions_Boat_03_02": "Following the road south, you will reach a bridge. Next to it you will find this boat.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Questions_Boat_03_03": "It was used by fishermen, but for some time it has been a point of exchange of goods between the village and Little Vineyard.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Questions_Rolf_15_01": "What does Rolf look like?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Questions_Rolf_03_02": "He's a little boy. I'm guessing about your age. He's got a ponytail, and he's not exactly a muscle man. When he left, he was wearing a typical sleeveless country outfit.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Beast_15_01": "By the way, Rolf mentioned that he saw some kind of Beast.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Beast_03_02": "For some time now, rumors have been circulating among the locals about a forest Beast terrorizing the area.",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Beast_03_03": "They say she sneaks along the edge of the forest, watching for villagers returning from fields and fishing spots. Few have seen it, and even fewer have experienced an encounter with it...",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_Beast_03_04": "If Rolf actually saw the Beast, he was pretty lucky to get out of this one.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Ambient_15_00": "How are you doing?",
  "DIA_Folkard_Ambient_13_01": "It's all quiet.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Ambient_13_02": "It makes me a little uneasy because silence usually heralds a storm.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Ambient_13_03": "All is well, at least for now.",
  "DIA_Folkard_Ambient_13_04": "Sometimes you have to chase a scavenger from under the gate or cover up molerat burrow. Otherwise, it's quiet.",
  "DIA_Folkard_JornGone_haveuseen_Choice": "Have you seen Jorn anywhere lately?",
  "DIA_Folkard_SQ109_RolfDead_IDontWantThat_Choice": "Pass them on to Rolf's family."
