  "DIA_Rasco_Hello_House_15_01": "Uh... nice hut.",
  "DIA_Rasco_Hello_House_03_02": "It may be pretty, but it's not yours. So I ask you again. What do you want?",
  "DIA_Rasco_Hello_LostWay_15_01": "Looks like I took the wrong turn.",
  "DIA_Rasco_Hello_LostWay_03_02": "Come on, get out! If I see you here again, I won't be so nice!",
  "DIA_Rasco_Hello_LostWay_03_03": "Second time? What a coincidence.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_15_01": "Otho sent me. He sent me to put a package of sheep dung in your bed.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_03_02": "I can see he's up to some bad jokes.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_15_03": "He said you kidnapped his sheep named Betsy.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_03_04": "I never touched his damn sheep! He probably just lost it somewhere. But sure, the easiest way is to blame it on me!",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_03_05": "Listen, I have a proposition for you.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_03_06": "I don't know how much Otho promised you, but I'll pay you twice as much as he did if you drop this dung off in the court kitchen.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Why_15_01": "Why would I do that?",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Why_03_02": "If not for Ramsey's grace, Otho would still be a beggar. But Ramsey is far away, and Albyn is the Elder of the village.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Why_03_03": "Otho has been at odds with him for a long time. Seeing such a surprise, the Elder will easily take the bait and this bastard will get what he deserves.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Reward_15_01": "What do I get in return?",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Reward_03_02": "Do what I told you first, and then we'll talk about the reward.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Refuse_15_01": "And what if I refuse?",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Refuse_03_02": "I wouldn't advise it. You see, you're new here, and newbies tend to get into trouble quickly, especially without friends by their side.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Refuse_03_03": "You know what I mean?",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Okay_15_01": "All right, I'll do it.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Okay_03_02": "Good choice, kid. Sneak into Ramsey's manor at night while everyone's snoring away.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Okay_03_03": "Leave the bundle in the kitchen. Preferably among the supplies. By morning the stench will be all over the manor and Albyn will be furious.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Okay_03_04": "When you're done, come back to me and you'll be rewarded.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_15_01": "I did what you wanted.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_03_02": "Now just waiting for Otho to land on the rug!",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_03_03": "About that reward...",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_03_04": "If you want gold, I'll warn you that I'm not rich, but I have this one ring here. I can't remember where I got it anymore, but you can sell it for a few good coins.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_03_05": "I can also tell you how to get into town.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_Ring_15_01": "I'll take that ring.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_Ring_03_02": "Here. May it serve you well.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_Problem_15_01": "Getting into town is a hassle?",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_Problem_03_02": "Have you ever tried to go in there? The guards will stop you on the spot, and attempt of struggle will end up worse than a few bruises after a tavern brawl.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_City_15_01": "Tell me how to get into town.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_City_03_02": "There should be guard Edgar stationed at one of the gates. He's a miserable swine. If you look at him in a wrong way, he'll be ready to fight.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_City_03_03": "His friend, on the other hand, has a heart of gold. He helped many people and let them into the city.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_City_03_04": "Prepare and offer him exactly 75 gold coins. That's our password. No more, no less.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Done_City_03_05": "If you make a mistake, you're left with the sewer route, and I'm telling you, you wouldn't want that very much.",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_15_01": "You know anything about Kurt's break-in?",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_03_02": "Maybe, maybe not.",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_03_03": "You helped me out last time, so you're my man. There's something fishy, but I'll tell you what I know.",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_03_04": "In the evening I heard some strange, deafening noises coming from Kurt's hut. They sounded like the guy was holding some cave troll in there!",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_03_05": "They lasted a good while, the storm subsided, but I kept my head down so as not to provoke anyone or anything.",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_03_06": "Then Kurt arrived on the scene, all furious, and in time other people from the village began to descend.",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_03_07": "You know, kid, I don't know you, but I can tell right away you like to bring trouble.",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_03_08": "And I generally don't get into trouble when I don't have to.",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_WantSomeGold_15_01": "Maybe a couple of coins will convince you?",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_WantSomeGold_03_02": "A couple, how many?",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_10_15_01": "Here you are.",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_10_03_02": "Thanks, my friend. So here's what happened...",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_Brother_15_01": "It's about my brother. Looks like he's been kidnapped.",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_Brother_03_02": "Kidnapped? That's really sad.",
  "DIA_Rasco_GQ001_Jorn_Brother_03_03": "Now piss off!",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_15_01": "Apparently you're interested in a certain stuff.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_03_02": "Depends on what you mean by that.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_15_03": "This.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_03_04": "You made me curious before boy, but now you have my full attention!",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_03_05": "How much do you want for a joint?",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_01": "Agreed.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_02": "It's a pleasure doing business with you.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_03": "Incidentally, whose stuff is this?",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_04": "There's too much you want to know... Oh, from such a... source...",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_05": "You've only been here a short time, and I see you're a fast learner.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_06": "If you ever have any more joints, you know where to find me.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_07": "I got it from a trader named Petra.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_08": "That's interesting. I never would have thought of that. Thanks for the information.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_09": "You can tell her that she just got extra customers.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_10": "Five.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_11": "Three.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_12": "Four.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_13": "Make it four.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_14": "Ten.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_15": "Six.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_16": "Eight.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_17": "Five.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_18": "Six.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_19": "Fine.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_20": "Fifteen.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_21": "Eight.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_22": "Twelve.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_23": "No way.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_24": "You accept eight or there is no deal.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_15_25": "So be it.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_26": "You know... I'll make an exception for you, but only because you helped me frame Otho. I'm still laughing about it.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_27": "Ten gold coins is my final offer.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Offer_03_28": "Your loss. I have no intention of overpaying for average quality merchandise.",
  "DIA_Rasco_Hello_03_01": "Why are you snooping around for that's not yours? Speak or I'll gut you!",
  "DIA_Rasco_Ambient_15_01": "How are you doing?",
  "DIA_Rasco_Ambient_03_02": "What if we just chucked it all to hell and sailed on Khorinis?",
  "DIA_Rasco_Ambient_03_03": "The question is, where would I get enough booze for such a long trip?",
  "DIA_Rasco_Ambient_03_04": "I recently came to a surprising conclusion.",
  "DIA_Rasco_Ambient_03_05": "Alcohol works like magic, it's only safer than it.",
  "DIA_Rasco_Ambient_03_06": "You drink, drink, drink and eventually you forget all about it!",
  "DIA_Rasco_SellJoints_15_01": "I have more joints for you.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ202_Dunno_Choice": "I prefer not to reveal my sources.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SellJoints_JointFive_Choice": "Sell 5 pieces.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SellJoints_JointOne_Choice": "Sell 1 piece.",
  "DIA_Rasco_SQ102_Otho_Choice": "Otho sent me."
