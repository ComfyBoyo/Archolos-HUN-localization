  "DIA_Dismas_Hello_03_01": "Hello, boy! I guess you're new here?",
  "DIA_Dismas_Hello_15_02": "Yes, that's right. I recently arrived on the island.",
  "DIA_Dismas_Hello_03_03": "You remind me of myself years ago when I sailed to Archolos.",
  "DIA_Dismas_Hello_03_04": "The riches hidden in the local mines were the talk of the entire kingdom!",
  "DIA_Dismas_Hello_03_05": "Everyone wanted a little bit for themselves...",
  "DIA_Dismas_YouWereAMiner_15_01": "Did you work in a mine?",
  "DIA_Dismas_YouWereAMiner_03_02": "Yeah, but that's ancient history. I can't work in the mine anymore...",
  "DIA_Dismas_YouWereAMiner_03_03": "But if you want, I can tell you about mining for a small fee.",
  "DIA_Dismas_YouWereAMiner_03_04": "Remember, however, that such theory is only an introduction to the subject. If you want to become a real miner, you have to grab a pickaxe in your hand and fight with the rock.",
  "DIA_Dismas_Ambient_03_01": "It's strange that so many bad things happen on the island and it's still quiet here. Well, usually.",
  "DIA_Dismas_Ambient_03_02": "Not so good. The problems caused by the war have reached even here, it's terrible...",
  "DIA_Dismas_Q506_HelloAgain_03_03": "I'm telling you, I feel like this trip is going to bring us a lot of gold! I'll build myself a house, buy a field, and hire some workers... I advise you to plan your future too!",
  "DIA_Dismas_Q506_HelloAgain_03_01": "Look who's here! Wasn't it some time ago that you were running all over Silbach looking for any work?",
  "DIA_Dismas_Q506_HelloAgain_03_02": "I see Kessel has managed to gather a really interesting bunch of people for this expedition. No wonder, he convinced me in minutes."
