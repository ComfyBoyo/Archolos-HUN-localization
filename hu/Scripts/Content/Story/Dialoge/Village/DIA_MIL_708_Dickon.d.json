  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_15_01": "Are you a sentry?",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_02": "Can't you see?",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_15_03": "Not exactly.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_04": "Get to the point. What do you want?",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_15_05": "Look, I need you to help me...",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_03_06": "First of all, I don't have to do anything, and second of all, I'm on break right now, so get the hell out of here.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_WantSomeBeer_15_01": "What's a break without a pint of beer?",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_WantSomeBeer_03_02": "You know, you're right. I've got a dry throat from all that standing around.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_WantSomeBeer_03_03": "Make yourself useful and get me a beer. Then we'll talk.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_YouMustHelpMe_15_01": "You're a sentry. It's your duty to help people.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_YouMustHelpMe_03_02": "My only duties are to keep an eye on this crumbling hole, and if there are problems, the elder calls the city guard and trouble is over.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_YouMustHelpMe_03_03": "Besides, I don't get paid enough to stick my neck out for anyone, much less for some bums.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_YouMustHelpMe_03_04": "So, I'll say it again: get out of here, you little snot!",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_GotBeer_15_01": "Here, I brought you a beer.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_GotBeer_03_02": "You weren't in much of a hurry.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_GotBeer_03_03": "Now, that's what you call a real watch!",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_GotBeer_03_04": "Harry and Kipper will turn green with envy when I tell them I got my own errand boy!",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_GotBeer_15_05": "Yeah, whatever. Are you gonna help me now or not?",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_GotBeer_03_06": "Okay, tell me what's going on.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_GotBeer_15_07": "Ezekiel's daughter's body was left on the beach. The old man is heartbroken. Perhaps you could help bring it to the cemetery?",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_GotBeer_03_08": "Admittedly, I don't like to leave the gate unguarded, but for such a worthy cause I might find a replacement.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_GotBeer_03_09": "Have him let us know when we're leaving.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_15_01": "Did a man named Jorn come through here?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_03_02": "Who's that?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_15_03": "My brother, Jorn. He's bald and about my height, but has slightly broader shoulders.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_15_04": "We recently arrived in the village with the rest of our companions.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_03_05": "It's obvious why I don't know the guy.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_03_06": "You're the kind of stragglers who beg and hang around.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_15_07": "Did you see him or not?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_03_08": "I don't recall.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_City_15_01": "Many citizens visit Silbach?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_City_03_02": "Too many, in my opinion. Fortunately, I'm instructed to check only those who come in, not out.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_City_15_03": "If you only check those who come into the village, how do you know my brother didn't leave the village?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_City_03_04": "Why should I bother? Besides, the fewer strangers, the better for us.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_Someone_15_01": "Did you see anyone suspicious?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_Someone_03_02": "More questions? Questions make me thirsty.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Jorn_Someone_03_03": "Do you have anything to rinse throat?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_03_05": "Not long ago some visitors got so drunk that they had to carry one of them through the gate.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_15_06": "Remember what they looked like?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_03_08": "One of them was as big and thick as a barrel of wine, the other one was thin, so thin that he almost resembled a pole, and in the middle there was an unfortunate man, who apparently did not know how to weigh his strength.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_03_09": "I always say - don't pour more into your mouth than your stomach can handle.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_15_01": "Here, cheers. I hope you choke.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_03_02": "I've drank better, but for a short break from work, it's just right.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_03_03": "Keep the rest. I don't want to end up like that drinker last time.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_15_04": "What drinker?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_Victim_15_04": "That's all I needed to know.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_Victim_03_05": "Finally, you're making sense.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_Victim_15_01": "What did the wretch look like?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_Victim_03_02": "You think I can remember the face of every stranger who wanders in here?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_Victim_03_03": "I have no idea what he looked like.",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_Where_15_01": "Which way did they go?",
  "DIA_Dickon_GQ001_Beer_Where_03_02": "Probably where they came from, which is towards the city.",
  "DIA_Dickon_SQ118_NeedHelp_YouMustHelpMe_Choice": "You're a sentry. You're supposed to help people."
