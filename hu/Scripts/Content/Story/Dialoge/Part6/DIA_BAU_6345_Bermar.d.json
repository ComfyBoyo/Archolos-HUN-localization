  "DIA_Bermar_HELLO_03_01": "I don't know who let you in here, but apparently I need to talk to Willem about it.",
  "DIA_Bermar_HELLO_03_02": "What are you looking for on my land?",
  "DIA_Bermar_Who_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Bermar_Who_03_02": "I'm Bermar, and this is my farm.",
  "DIA_Bermar_Who_03_03": "There's nothing else you need to know.",
  "DIA_Bermar_FoundOrc_15_01": "I saw an orc near your farm.",
  "DIA_Bermar_FoundOrc_03_02": "Did I hear you right? Did you say 'orc'?",
  "DIA_Bermar_FoundOrc_15_03": "You didn't mishear.",
  "DIA_Bermar_FoundOrc_03_04": "Don't make me laugh, boy! There are no orcs on this island.",
  "DIA_Bermar_FoundOrc_03_05": "At most, overgrown goblins and dullards talking nonsense like you!",
  "DIA_Bermar_Ambient_15_01": "How are you doing?",
  "DIA_Bermar_Ambient_03_06": "Be careful, boy. Everything you see here belongs to me, and I hate thieves.",
  "DIA_Bermar_Ambient_03_07": "Morris may offer me whole carts of gold, but as long as I'm alive, he won't lay his hands on my land.",
  "DIA_Bermar_Ambient_03_08": "You're in MY house and you're staining MY floor!",
  "DIA_Bermar_Ambient_03_09": "You're gonna make my wife work twice as hard now.",
  "DIA_Bermar_QM303_Search_15_01": "Have you been visited by two guards recently?",
  "DIA_Bermar_QM303_Search_03_02": "Yes, I have. They took the agreed goods and left. Why? If they did something to it, it's not my fault.",
  "DIA_Bermar_QM303_Search_15_03": "Sure, take it easy. They just still haven't come back and I was sent to find them.",
  "DIA_Bermar_QM303_Search_03_04": "If they haven't returned, I suggest you search the surrounding woods. All sorts of beasts inhabit them, and any one of them might have a taste for the food-smelling packages.",
  "DIA_Bermar_KQ407_WhatHappend_15_01": "Will you tell me what happened?",
  "DIA_Bermar_KQ407_WhatHappend_03_02": "Everything I had worked for was destroyed in a few moments. That's what happened.",
  "DIA_Bermar_KQ407_WhatHappend_15_03": "Don't worry, we'll take back your farm.",
  "DIA_Bermar_KQ407_WhatHappend_03_04": "That's great! Will you bring my loved ones and workers back from the dead too?",
  "DIA_Bermar_KQ407_WhatHappend_03_05": "Damn that farm. Nothing will be the same again.",
  "DIA_Bermar_KQ407_WhatHappend_03_06": "I have nothing left to live for.",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_15_01": "Do you have a job for me?",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_03_02": "I don't need extra farm hands at this point. We are slowly finishing the harvest, and if nothing suddenly destroys my farm, this will be my best year yet.",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_03_03": "Not only has the land cropped well, but prices are higher than in past years!",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_03_04": "You can talk to my workers, maybe one of them will need urgent help...",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_03_05": "You hear that?",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_03_06": "That kid started his sawing again. I think my head's gonna fall off...",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_Farm_15_01": "It's your farm, can't you kick him out?",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_Farm_03_02": "It's not that simple. That fool with two left hands is my son, Kyle.",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_Farm_03_03": "I told him to find something to do so he wouldn't be idling around all day. How was I to know he'd put that pile of boards right under the house?",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_Farm_03_04": "You asked about work, so maybe you'd like to look after my son?",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_Farm_15_05": "You want me to look after him?",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Start_Farm_03_06": "Just help him find a less annoying activity. And even if that doesn't work out, a few hours without that damned noise will be good too.",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Finish_15_01": "I took care of your son.",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Finish_03_02": "And how did your day go? Did you manage to teach him anything useful?",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Finish_Climb_15_01": "I taught him a thing or two about climbing.",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Finish_Climb_03_02": "I just hope you didn't venture too far out there!",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Finish_Climb_03_03": "It was good that the boy had learned something useful. Next time he is attacked by wolves in the forest, at least he will be able to hide from them.",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Finish_Climb_03_04": "I know how troublesome Kyle can be, so thank you all the more for taking care of him. Here, this is a reward.",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Finish_Leave_15_01": "I showed him it wasn't worth the risk to climb just anywhere. He is now sitting in a tree at the edge of the farm waiting for someone to pull him down.",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Finish_Leave_03_02": "And you probably think that's funny? Don't forget, he's my son. I know he can be annoying and I told you to get him out of here myself, but don't risk his health and life!",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Finish_Leave_03_03": "Take that gold, so you don't say later I don't pay my workers, and give me a break.",
  "DIA_Bermar_SQ125_Finish_Leave_Choice": "I showed him it wasn't worth the risk..."
