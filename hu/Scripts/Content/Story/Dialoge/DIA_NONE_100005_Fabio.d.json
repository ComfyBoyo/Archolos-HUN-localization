  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_AfterFight_Wood_15_02": "What'll it be? You gonna go get that brushwood?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_AfterFight_Wood_05_03": "I'll go...",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_AfterFight_Wood_05_04": "I just hope that if something attacks us, you'll be just as eager to fight!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_AfterFight_Wood_05_05": "And don't think I'm going to forget it...",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_AfterFight_Wood_05_06": "Well, what was that for?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_AfterFight_Wood_05_07": "I at least faintly hope you've wised up. Go get that brushwood, now!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_05_01": "I see you survived after all. Anybody else left on the beach?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_01_02": "Just dead bodies.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_05_03": "Oh, well.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_05_04": "While you were crawling ashore, I had time to do some recon. There's a cave nearby where we'll be safe.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_01_05": "We should move on.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_05_06": "Where do you think you're going? Do you even know the area? Because I don't, and I don't want to end up in the belly of some forest beast.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_01_07": "I was once on Archolos as a child. Besides, I could see the mouth of the river from the ship. It must not be far.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_01_08": "If we walk along it, it is possible that we will come across the village of Silbach, where our uncle lives.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_05_09": "As a child?! The village might as well be burned and your uncle butchered by orcs. The safest thing is to stay here and wait until dawn.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_05_10": "Why don't we ask the rest of you for your opinion?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_05_11": "You, kid. What do you think?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_QuestionEnd_15_10": "I'm sorry, Jorn, but I can't go any further. The cave seems like a better idea to me.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_QuestionEnd_01_11": "Okay, I understand. Hopefully we'll all meet again back in the village.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_QuestionEnd_01_12": "Take care of yourself, Marvin. I'll try to make you some kind of welcome. Remember, you gotta head east.",

  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_QuestionEnd_01_07": "I knew you'd make a sound decision, brother.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_QuestionEnd_01_08": "Anyone else heading to the village with us?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_QuestionEnd_01_09": "Okay, I understand. Hopefully we'll all meet again back in the village.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_QuestionEnd_15_01": "That's all I needed to know.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_QuestionEnd_05_02": "Good, at least we're not wasting any more time. You, Jorn, or whatever your name is, I have no intention of dealing with you.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_QuestionEnd_05_03": "I'm going to a warm cave and I recommend you do the same!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_QuestionEnd_01_05": "Marvin, stop fooling around and come on. We've already wasted too much time!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_Question1_15_01": "Are you sure you remember the way to the village?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_Question1_01_02": "More or less.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_Question1_01_03": "Archolos is a densely populated island. Sooner or later you will come across a settlement.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_Question2_15_01": "What condition are the survivors in?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_Question2_05_02": "Those weaklings won't get far. Hell, we won't make it to the village!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_Question3_15_01": "Maybe we can find this village?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_Question3_05_02": "If we don't get lost in this darkness and accidentally run into some shadowbeast!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_Question3_05_03": "No, thank you! I'd rather wait until it's light.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_Question4_15_01": "Will we be safe in the cave?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_JornTrialog_Question4_05_02": "Why? Are you afraid of molerats? If so, go with your little brother!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_05_06": "You, you go get the brushwood.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_05_07": "And why me?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_05_08": "Because it's your turn.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_05_09": "You want to talk about it?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_05_10": "Fine.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_05_11": "Just don't take too long.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_05_01": "There's nothing like warming up your muscles properly after an ice cold bath!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_05_02": "Now all you have to do is light the fire and you can throw something on the grill!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_15_03": "It may have been a good warm up, but how do you know we're safe already?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_05_04": "I see you're just a little chicken!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_05_05": "Since the molerats felt safe here, it meant there was nothing more dangerous nearby.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_05_06": "Any dumbass knows that.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_05_07": "And anyway, kid, what was on the ship was on the ship. What's important is what's happening now.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_15_08": "Let's say we're even...",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_05_09": "Sure, just one more thing left to do.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_05_10": "Come on, company, sit down! Marvin's gonna bring us some wood, and then I'm gonna start a fire!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_15_11": "Excuse me?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_05_12": "Are you having trouble hearing? Or should I fist-bump your ears?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_05_13": "You go get the brushwood or you don't get the grub!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_Okay_15_01": "All right, I'll go.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_Okay_05_02": "Well, I didn't expect any other answer. Hurry up, my bones are freezing!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_Okay_15_03": "A boss like that is a treasure...",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NoWay_15_01": "Go get that brushwood yourself.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NoWay_15_02": "Unless you want to get punched in the face again?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NoWay_05_03": "You son of a... no... all right, I'll go.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NoWay_05_04": "What?!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NoWay_15_05": "After all, no one can do it better than you.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NoWay_05_06": "Something tells me it's been a long time since you've got spanked! You go get some brushwood or else we'll talk!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_15_01": "Send someone else.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_05_02": "Someone else? Who else?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_15_03": "Surely there is someone here who is better suited to the task.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_05_04": "You're just a slob, that's all! I'd beat you to a pulp, but I've got to save my hands for the fire.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_NotMe_05_05": "I'll find someone else, but you can't count on a free meal!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_CalmDown_15_01": "Okay, okay, I'll go...",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_CalmDown_05_02": "Yeah! That's how it was supposed to be from the beginning! Move it!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_Fight_15_01": "Make me.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_Fight_05_02": "You wanted this!",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_Beer_15_01": "I brought you a beer, remember?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_Beer_05_02": "I remember, and?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_Beer_15_03": "Maybe someone else will go?",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_Beer_05_04": "Actually... if it wasn't for you, I'd probably die of thirst out there.",
  "TRIA_Fabio_Q102_Molerats_Beer_05_05": "Okay, you're fine. I'm not sending you out into the wilderness.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_FirePlace_05_01": "Well, that's the first problem out of the way.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_FirePlace_05_02": "I'd like to invite you for a roasted molerat!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Wood_15_01": "Here you are. I brought some brushwood.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Wood_05_02": "Let me see what you got there.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Wood_05_03": "Well, well, and even reasonably dry.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Wood_05_04": "Maybe you'll be a man after all.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Wood_05_05": "Time to take care of the campfire. Watch and learn!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_KazemBack_05_01": "See? This is how it's done.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Meat_15_01": "You've got a tasty morsel there. Can I try it?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Meat_05_02": "Yeah... Sure. Take it, but only one portion!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Meat_05_03": "There's no grub for slackers.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Meat_05_04": "Go pick up some scraps in the woods!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Night_15_01": "Do you think this night will be peaceful?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Night_05_02": "What am I, clairvoyant? Light can both scare and attract some animals.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Night_05_03": "I'm counting on you to get off your ass and help me get rid of them if I need to?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Night_15_04": "I don't think I'll have a choice.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Night_05_05": "Probably not. In any case, we could all use a rest. Find a corner and take a nap.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_Night_05_06": "We don't need any more weaklings delaying the march.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_ToSilbach_05_01": "Damn, they must have smelled that roast meat. There's no point in sitting here any longer.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_ToSilbach_05_02": "You and Rupert will move ahead and clear a path to the east. We will follow your lead and meet you at a nearby village.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q103_Village_05_01": "Looks like your brother did pretty well, plus he got us into the village. I didn't even have to punch anyone!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q103_Village_15_02": "And very well, then we'd be in real trouble.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q103_Village_05_03": "Talk!",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_05_01": "Oh, it's you. What do you want?",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_uknow_15_01": "Do you know anything about Jorn's disappearance?",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_uknow_05_02": "The smart one? The one that got bit by the bloodflies?",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_uknow_15_03": "Exactly.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_uknow_05_04": "I don't know anything. I heard that the whole place was trashed, so I wish I could have been there, but I had nothing to do with Jorn.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_thanks_15_01": "Okay, thanks.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_thanks_05_02": "I don't know what you're thanking me for. Eh, I'll have to do some thinking in the meantime. I've had enough of this village, and I think I'll head for town.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_thanks_05_03": "Maybe people there won't be the pussies they are here.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_usure_15_01": "Are you sure?",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_usure_05_03": "Oh, come on! I wouldn't even raise a hand to him, let alone drive him out of the village! Calm down, or I'll punch you in the face!",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_JornGone_usure_15_04": "I hope you're telling the truth.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance_05_00": "Not so fast, snot!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance_15_01": "What do you want?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance_05_02": "I heard you were seeing your uncle.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance_15_02": "I may have, what's it to you?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance_05_03": "Not everyone here is as well positioned as you and your brother.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance_05_04": "It would be nice if you would stand up for us with him. After all... we've been through so much together!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance1_15_01": "What's in it for me?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance1_05_00": "My... eternal gratitude!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance1_05_01": "My undying gratitude and that my fist will not adorn your face.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance2_15_01": "What specifically do you want me to do?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance2_05_00": "I saw that the locals keep a small livestock farm. In addition to sheep, I also noticed a ram.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance2_05_01": "I wonder what their meat tastes like...",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance2_05_02": "Bring me a decent roast steak of one of them!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance2_1_15_01": "I'll see what I can do.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance2_1_05_01": "You're a fast learner, snot!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance3_15_01": "No way, leech. You'd finally do something yourself instead of constantly preying on others.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance3_05_01": "Watch it, punk. This island doesn't look big to me.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance3_05_02": "It's better for you that I never see your smooth face again.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_StakeAndBeer_Description": "A well-done steak for your lordship.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_StakeAndBeer_15_01": "Here you go, a well-done steak for your lordship.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_StakeAndBeer_05_02": "Well, well... I'm really starting to like you, kid!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_StakeAndBeer_05_03": "You know your place in the herd, not like the rest of this ungrateful bunch.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_StakeAndBeer_05_04": "Here's some coins and get out of here.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_StakeAndBeer_15_05": "So, what's it gonna be, you agree to work for Albyn for a while?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_StakeAndBeer_05_06": "Damn, stupid peasants... But I've got to eat something, and if someone serves me that inn dishwater again, I won't be able to stand it.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_StakeAndBeer_05_07": "Fine, tell the old man I'll work for him.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_StakeAndBeer_15_08": "Who knows, you might even like it...",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_15_00": "I'm back from the Elder.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_05_01": "And what did the Elder tell you?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_15_02": "That he will take care of us if we start working for him.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_05_03": "That's his suggestion, huh?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_05_04": "That steak you brought me was quite tasty, and the beer tasted like a real Londram dark.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_05_05": "All right, then. I'll help the old man, but don't let him think I'm going to work the fields like his minions.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_05_06": "Tell that moron to stick his head between his legs and kiss his own ass!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_WorkForAlbyn_05_07": "I will serve no one.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_AngeredWorkForAlbyn_Description": "Maybe we can work it out?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_AngeredWorkForAlbyn_15_00": "I think you wanted me to help you with something. Why don't we make a deal?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_AngeredWorkForAlbyn_05_01": "Ha! So now you've suddenly had a change of heart?",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_WeNeedHelp_15_01": "We need to go back for Darryl and Maiwen.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_WeNeedHelp_05_02": "Go back if you want. It's none of my business.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_WeNeedHelp_15_03": "Can you really rest easy knowing they are in danger?",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_WeNeedHelp_05_04": "The truth is, everyone only cares about their own fat ass.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_WeNeedHelp_05_05": "You are a sheep - then you become nothing but food for the wolf. You are strong - you are the wolf.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_WeNeedHelp_05_06": "I prefer to be the latter.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_WeNeedHelp_15_07": "I think if you showed even a little compassion, others would help you.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_WeNeedHelp_05_08": "They'd be pretty damn stupid.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_WeNeedHelp_05_09": "I only helped others so I wouldn't die in the wilderness myself, and as I said, I don't owe anyone anything.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_15_01": "I see you care a hell of a lot about your comrades.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_05_02": "What are you talking about?",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_15_03": "In the cave on the coast, I found the bodies of Darryl and Maiwen.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_15_04": "Why don't you tell me what happened to them?",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_05_05": "How would I know? They were still alive when we left the cave. Probably some animals got them.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_05_06": "The foolish woman insisted on staying with her dying man.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_15_07": "And you decided to leave them to their fate.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_05_08": "What, you think I should've dragged her back to the village by force?",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_05_09": "I gave her a simple choice. She could have come with us, but she stayed with the corpse. So much for that.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_05_10": "The guy was leaking like an old boat all night. He wouldn't last long anyway.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_05_11": "If you think I had anything to do with their deaths, you must be a damn idiot.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_15_01": "Do you know anything about Jorn's disappearance?",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_05_02": "Is that bald headed wise guy lost?",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_15_03": "Looks like someone kidnapped him.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_05_04": "Good for him. Maybe he finally got a solid beating from someone for his constant yapping!",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_15_05": "You've been at odds with my brother since the beginning of our journey, which makes you a prime suspect.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_05_07": "True, I never liked him, but I had no reason to kidnap him!",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_05_08": "And even if I did, what are you gonna do to me, you little shit?",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_IWillBeatYou_15_01": "Tell me what you know or I'll teach you a lesson.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_IWillBeatYou_05_02": "Hahahaha! You can try.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_IWillBeatYou_05_03": "I'll crush you like a meatbug!",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_IWillTellAlbyn_15_01": "People say you're just causing trouble here. They won't care if you were behind it or not. The important thing is they get rid of the troublemaker.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_IWillTellAlbyn_05_02": "And what do you think you're going to do?",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_IWillTellAlbyn_15_03": "All I have to do is tell Kurt about you, he tells the elder, and the elder takes care of the rest...",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_IWillTellAlbyn_05_04": "All right, all right... relax!",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_IWillTellAlbyn_05_05": "For your information, I had nothing to do with your brother's kidnapping. Why would I do that anyway?",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_AfterFight_Lost_05_01": "Didn’t you have enough, snot?",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_AfterFight_Won_05_01": "Enough, don't hit me anymore!",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_AfterFight_Won_15_02": "Tell me or I'll break your jaw again.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_ToSilbach_Okay_15_01": "Let's go.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_ToSilbach_Okay_05_02": "Just don't get eaten by something along the way.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_ToSilbach_Why_15_01": "Why us?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_ToSilbach_Why_05_02": "Because you guys handle those beasts pretty well. Would you rather wait here and argue about who gets to go while more beasts get here?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_05_01": "Well, well, well, look who's here! Long time no see!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_15_02": "Why your presence here doesn't surprise me...",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_05_03": "You got a problem? It's been a while since you got punched in the face, huh?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_Why_15_01": "Why are you hanging out here?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_Why_05_02": "What do you mean, what for? Equal treatment!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_Why_05_03": "The people of Archolos live like some nobles, and they won't give us a broken penny or a small meal!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_Why_05_04": "Apparently, the lord of this castle is extremely rich, surely he will share some of his wealth with those affected by the war! We deserve it!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_Where_15_01": "Couldn't you set up camp somewhere else?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_Where_05_02": "We tried to do it, but I'm telling you, the locals are the biggest scrooges in the Kingdom!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_Where_05_03": "We politely asked in the city for a roof over our heads, food, decent clothes, medicines and a chance to recuperate after exhausting travels, and they what?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_Meeting_Where_05_04": "They started calling us leeches and wretches, do you have any idea? The lord of this castle is our last chance for a decent life!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_15_01": "I want you out of here.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_05_02": "And why is that?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_15_03": "You're disturbing the people of the castle. How do you expect to negotiate when all you're associated with is trouble?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_05_04": "There's a philosopher. If the needy bother them, what kind of followers of Adanos are they? They should be ashamed of themselves!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_05_05": "Now turn nicely on your heel and go tell them that we need shelter. People are in bad shape, they need a warm corner, food and so on.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_NotGood_15_01": "Think: this is not a good place to camp.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_NotGood_05_02": "Just because some little girls don't like us, we won't go away. Why are you still standing here?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_NotGood_15_03": "I'm trying to talk some sense into you. The area's not safe. Wild animals, a volcano right next door... all sorts of bad things can happen.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_NotGood_05_04": "Wild animals won't come this close to a human settlement, and the volcano activates once every few years. There's nothing to be afraid of.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_Work_15_01": "You could earn everything you need.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_Work_05_02": "As if anyone here has a decent job to offer!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_Mine_15_01": "You can work in any mine.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_Mine_05_02": "Sure, and they'll make us slaves because we don't have citizenship! That's out!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_Vineyard_15_01": "Every pair of hands comes in handy in the vineyards.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_Vineyard_05_02": "Do you really think the winemakers would let us in on their precious crop? You're naive!",
  "DIA_Q401_FabioJoints_15_01": "Start growing something.",
  "DIA_Q401_FabioJoints_05_02": "Like what?",
  "DIA_Q401_FabioJoints_15_03": "I don't know, maybe swampweed, after all there are some wetlands around here. People will like you for that!",
  "DIA_Q401_FabioJoints_15_04": "In addition, when you start paying the standard small security fees, the authorities will also look at you more favorably.",
  "DIA_Q401_FabioJoints_05_05": "We could deal with the weed... but I can already see the 'small' fee! We'll probably have to give away most of the crop, and the profits from the rest will be too small to pay for 'protection'. No fools!",
  "DIA_Q401_FabioJoints_15_06": "You hesitated, I heard.",
  "DIA_Q401_FabioJoints_05_07": "You were imagining it.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_Protect_15_01": "Maybe protect the farmers from field raiders?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_Protect_05_02": "Man, look at these people! Do they look like they could handle as much as a meatbug?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_Companions_15_01": "Do your comrades have any right to vote?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_Companions_05_02": "Er, most are not even worth listening to, let alone taking their opinions into consideration!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_NoWay_15_01": "I don't think we're going to reach a compromise.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoAway_NoWay_05_02": "You're a good guesser. You got anything else to say? No? Then get lost.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_15_01": "Will you move to the swamp?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_05_02": "I already told you no!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_05_03": "Galbo mentioned that it was a pretty good idea.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_05_04": "Sigmun finds this to be quite a thought.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_05_05": "Esti decided that working with the swampweed would be better for us than sitting here.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_05_06": "But we're staying here anyway.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_05_07": "It's still not enough to make me change my mind.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_05_08": "I don't think I have a choice. If I keep going against the rest of them, I'm going to end up getting...",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_05_09": "Just doesn't change the fact that the swamps sure as hell are dangerous, especially since you mentioned the security fees yourself!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_05_10": "Get us the money for at least one skilled defender!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_15_11": "Surely I can't change your mind?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_05_12": "No.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GoSwamp_15_13": "Eh, well, I'll be back soon.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GotProtection_Description": "That should be enough. (400 GP)",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GotProtection_15_01": "That should be enough.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GotProtection_05_02": "Good. We're not missing anything else.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GotProtection_15_03": "Just remember that now you will have to pay yourself.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GotProtection_05_04": "All right, all right. We'll go grow this weed, but if we can't pay for protection, I'll find you! Do you understand?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_GotProtection_15_05": "With my lifestyle you might have a problem with that. Anyway, congratulations on your wise decision and goodbye.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_WhatsWrong_15_01": "There seems to be something wrong with your camp.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_WhatsWrong_05_02": "Don't make me nervous! I almost died! If I hadn't gone for a piss, I'd be under those rocks right now!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_WhatsWrong_15_03": "Well, rock avalanches in these mountains are hardly unusual...",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_WhatsWrong_05_04": "Ordinary avalanches, yes, but this? Before the rocks hit the camp, I heard a bang! Where did it come from?",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_WhatsWrong_15_05": "Man, there's a volcano right here. They got their moods.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_WhatsWrong_05_06": "Hm... then we better keep away! I won't stay here a moment longer!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q401_WhatsWrong_15_07": "Just take the rest with you or they'll miss you.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_MagicCircle_Description": "In the depths of the cave I found some strange place...",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_MagicCircle_15_01": "In the depths of the cave I found some strange place, resembling a tomb. There was some kind of magical symbol right in the middle of it.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_MagicCircle_03_02": "A few stones on top of each other isn't a tomb yet. Don't even think about telling the others. If you weren't eaten, there's no reason to panic.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q102_MagicCircle_03_03": "They're all scared enough as it is, just short of running into the woods right now into the paws of some beast.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsNotDead_15_03": "Darryl is dead, and Maiwen was nearly killed by a lurker.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsNotDead_15_04": "Why did this happen?",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsNotDead_05_05": "How am I supposed to know that? I said we were leaving, but they decided to keep sitting on their asses.",
  "DIA_Fabio_SQ103_MaiwenIsDead_05_12": "If you think I had anything to do with his death, you must be a damn idiot.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Ambient_13_01": "Have you come to annoy me? If that's the case, don't bother. I'm trying to convince these villagers to start feeding us better.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Ambient_13_02": "I hope you don't want to ask about your brother again. I don't know anything, I haven't seen anything, look elsewhere.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Ambient_13_03": "I actually like it here. You're gonna have to work hard to get us out of here.",
  "DIA_Fabio_Ambient_13_04": "You're still asking? The volcano almost killed us, so I'm glad to be alive!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Ambient_13_05": "I still can't believe I let you convince me. Me in the swamp... I never would have expected it!",
  "DIA_Fabio_Q104_FraternalAssistance3_Choice": "You could finally do something on your own.",
  "DIA_Fabio_GQ001_WhereIsJorn_IWillTellAlbyn_Choice": "The Elder will know everything."
