  "DIA_Lean_FirstWarn_03_04": "You may pass, Ulryk has just finished his last audience.",
  "DIA_Lean_FirstWarn_03_05": "Remember, he is the one who will end the conversation with you, not you with him!",
  "DIA_Lean_FirstWarn_15_02": "Still?",
  "DIA_Lean_FirstWarn_03_03": "Well, let's say.",
  "DIA_Lean_SecondWarn_03_01": "I already told you, there is no passage.",
  "DIA_Lean_Q403_CrawlerPlate_15_01": "I heard Jon was trying to make armor out of minecrawler plates.",
  "DIA_Lean_Q403_CrawlerPlate_03_02": "Yeah, there was something, but I think he just threw that idea around. He was never good at crafts.",
  "DIA_Lean_Q403_CrawlerPlate_03_03": "His son was different. He's always been a handyman and a good hunter.",
  "DIA_Lean_Q403_CrawlerPlate_03_04": "Unfortunately, a few months ago he decided he wanted to see the world and sailed to Khorinis.",

  "DIA_Lean_FirstWarn_Steps_15_01": "Can you walk 2 steps on this damn island without someone stopping you?",
  "DIA_Lean_Ambient_15_01": "How's the guard duty?",
  "DIA_Lean_Ambient_03_02": "Duty like any other. I stand, I watch, I get a little bored, but at least I have time to think.",
  "DIA_Lean_Ambient_03_03": "Very well. I'll probably be chased into battle with the orcs before long, so I'm taking advantage of the last moments of peace.",
  "DIA_Lean_FirstWarn_Steps_Choice": "Can you go at least 2 steps..."
