  "DIA_Gaston_Who_15_01": "Who are you?",
  "DIA_Gaston_Who_03_02": "My name is Gaston, young man. I'm a hunter.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Who_03_03": "Or rather I was, because I don't hunt very often anymore. I've earned my keep in life. Now I am enjoying my retirement.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Who_What_15_01": "So what are you doing?",
  "DIA_Gaston_Who_What_03_02": "I am trying to teach my son hunting techniques. In our family, everyone, without exception, has a passion for hunting in their blood.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Who_What_03_03": "I also have my eye on the family business. From my daughter Lucy, you can buy decent bows.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Who_What_03_04": "In my free time I enjoy a delicious beer! This dark invention of the city brewer completely captivated me, I really recommend it.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Teach_15_01": "Can you teach me something?",
  "DIA_Gaston_Teach_03_02": "You know, I know how to gut game and make bows. For the right amount of gold, maybe I could teach you something...",
  "DIA_Gaston_Teach_03_03": "But first, buy me a beer. Just not any dishwater, okay? Dark Paladine.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachBow_15_01": "What about archery?",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachBow_03_02": "Sorry, but that's something I can only teach my family members. Those are the rules.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Beer_15_01": "Here's your beer.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Beer_03_02": "This is great. I'm telling you, you won't find a better one on this island! Now, I'm even willing to teach you master bowmaking techniques and... what the hell!",
  "DIA_Gaston_Beer_03_07": "If you know the basics of animal skinning, then I'll also show you how to obtain animal teeth and claws, shadowbeast horns, and the hearts of magical creatures. Not that I wish you to meet any!",
  "DIA_Gaston_Beer_03_03": "But this isn't the Dark Paladine! I don't drink that crap. Come back with a good beer, we won't start learning before then.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Beer_15_04": "Where can I buy it?",
  "DIA_Gaston_Beer_03_05": "Best at Tomas brewery, but you can probably get it at other places too.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Beer_15_06": "Okay, I'll be right back.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Ambient_15_01": "Are you all right?",
  "DIA_Gaston_Ambient_03_02": "The situation on the island is getting worse. Everyone is stocking up on food, so I have to hunt more and more. This will not end well for the nature of Archolos.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Ambient_03_03": "My son passed our family test, so yes, everything is as good as it gets!",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_15_01": "I talked to your son.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Shadowbeast_15_01": "Are you sure Nelson can kill a shadowbeast?",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Shadowbeast_03_02": "Of course. It's in his blood. On twentieth birthday, my grandfather, father, and older son did it. He'll do it too.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Death_15_01": "I've heard that one of your sons has already been killed while hunting...",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Death_03_02": "That's the job. There's always some risk, it's a man's profession. I can't hide the fact that I miss my son, but that's life.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Death_15_03": "Don't you think Nelson is unfit to be a hunter?",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Death_03_04": "Nonsense. Every man in our family was a hunter.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Magic_15_01": "It seems to me that he would rather occupy himself with the study of books of magic.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Magic_03_02": "You came here to annoy me?",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Save_15_01": "I came to save your son's life.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Save_03_02": "What are you talking about? If he can't do it, he's not worthy to be my son.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Save_15_03": "If you continue to force him to be what he is not, he will die anyway. The decision is yours.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Save_03_04": "Hm. Send him to me. And don't interfere in our affairs anymore.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Scared_15_01": "Sorry, I'm just scared for your son.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Scared_03_02": "I'm grateful. Nelson's got to get his own way. You can help him if you want, but without a horn I don't want to see him.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Hunter_15_01": "But not everyone can live to old age as a hunter.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Hunter_03_02": "You're right. It's just the way we live. I myself have risked my life many times to feed my children.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Hunter_03_03": "I'm sorry, but I don't feel like talking about this anymore.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Strong_15_01": "Nelson is a strong boy, but aren't you afraid for his life?",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Strong_03_02": "He will definitely gain some physical vigor and agility as he gets older. Nothing comes easy.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Strong_03_03": "He's an adult now. He has to manage somehow. We can't forget our traditions, they've gotten us this far.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Help_15_01": "Your son asked me to help him get a horn.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Help_03_02": "WHAT? Gods, a disgrace to my ancestors. I can't believe he would go to something like this.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Help_15_03": "Wait...",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Help_03_04": "Don't interrupt me! Let me just get this little bastard.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Help_03_05": "You may tell him that unless he proves to me that he is a man worthy of his blood, he may not show himself in my house. Goodbye.",
  "DIA_Gaston_WhereNelson_15_01": "What happened to your son?",
  "DIA_Gaston_WhereNelson_03_02": "I took care of him.",
  "DIA_Gaston_WhereNelson_15_03": "What does that mean? You know he's not a hunter!",
  "DIA_Gaston_WhereNelson_03_04": "Are you suggesting that I can't take care of my own son?",
  "DIA_Gaston_WhereNelson_Know_15_01": "I just want to know where he is.",
  "DIA_Gaston_WhereNelson_Know_03_02": "Don't worry. I think he's happy.",
  "DIA_Gaston_WhereNelson_No_15_01": "You've been rather unsuccessful so far.",
  "DIA_Gaston_WhereNelson_No_03_02": "Maybe one day you'll become a father yourself and see how hard it is to properly raise your offspring.",
  "DIA_Gaston_WhereNelson_No_03_03": "Now, please don't lecture me. Go, have a beer, have a taste of life. Drink on me. That's for helping Nelson.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachBow_03_03": "As a consolation, I can show you how to become more dexterous. Then someone else will have the foundation to teach you archery.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachBow_03_04": "And I don't want a beer for it, teaching dexterity is... Heh, fun in itself. Although... gold I'll gladly take, hehe!",
  "DIA_Gaston_Training_15_00": "I want to be more dexterous.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Training_13_01": "All right, then, let's do it!",
  "DIA_Gaston_TrainingBack_03_00": "You're really good. I can't teach you anything else.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TrainingDEX1_13_01": "You brought too little, I don't teach for such small change.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TrainingDEX5_13_01": "If you want to learn that much, you have to pay accordingly too!",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachFletchery2_15_01": "Teach me better bowmaking techniques.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachFletchery2_13_01": "At this level you should slowly become interested in composite weapons. Bows created from a combination of wood and horns can fire projectiles with such power that hardly anyone can withstand their impact.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachFletchery2_13_02": "Of course you can use a similar solution in crossbows. Putting the individual pieces together is difficult, but you'll get the hang of it over time. You just have to carefully check the quality of everything you create.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachFletchery2_13_03": "Look, I'm not asking for much anyway, you can raise the right amount.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachFletchery3_15_01": "Teach me master bowmaking techniques.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachFletchery3_13_01": "So you have reached the level where you are no longer interested in any compromises. From now on you have no forgiveness for even the smallest mistakes.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachFletchery3_13_02": "The individual components of the bows and crossbows you create must work perfectly together. You cannot turn a blind eye to even the smallest imperfections.",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachFletchery3_13_03": "Also, don't be afraid to experiment with new materials if you think they will improve the quality of your wares. Just to mention that I once saw a crossbow made entirely of metal - and it was powerful!",
  "DIA_Gaston_TeachFletchery3_13_04": "Look, I'm not asking for much anyway, you can raise the right amount.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_03_01": "No problem, let's see how you do.",
  "DIA_Gaston_AllHunt_03_01": "You're a born hunter. I can't teach you anything else.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Teeth_15_01": "How do you obtain animal fangs?",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Teeth_03_02": "You look into the mouth of the hunted animal, cut the gums with a sharp object and then pull out the fang with a steady movement. Be careful not to break it!",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Teeth_03_03": "You brought too little, I don't teach for such small change.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Claws_15_01": "How do you obtain animal claws?",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Claws_03_02": "You start by making sure the entire claw is extended. Once you have that behind you, you take the blade and incise the phalanx.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Claws_03_03": "The incision will make it easier for you to pull the claw out. You might pull a tendon along with it. In that case, just cut it.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Claws_03_04": "You brought too little, I don't teach for such small change.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Heart_15_01": "How to get the hearts of magical beings?",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Heart_03_02": "Stone golems you just smash a few times on the torso until it makes a gap. You reach into it and pull out the heart. In the case of swamp ones, you also have to shovel away the mud they are covered in.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Heart_03_03": "As for other beings... hmmm... I doubt you'll have the chance to meet a demon or any other of Beliar's creatures on Archolos, but the principle behind them is the same.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_Heart_03_04": "That's a little low, you need to bring more.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_ShadowHorn_15_01": "How do you obtain shadowbeast horns?",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_ShadowHorn_03_02": "You need to skillfully incise the skin around them so that the root is exposed. Then you pry it up with some kind of strong blade and loosen it.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_ShadowHorn_03_03": "Just twist the loose horn in different directions, eventually you'll be able to pull it out.",
  "DIA_Gaston_Hunting_Special_ShadowHorn_03_04": "That's not quite enough, you need to bring more.",
  "DIA_Gaston_SQ402Nelson_Shadowbeast_BACK_Choice": "(Let go)"
