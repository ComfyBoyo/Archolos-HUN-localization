  "DIA_Gron_Bolt_15_01": "Apparently you have some unusual bolts.",
  "DIA_Gron_Bolt_03_02": "I don't know anything about that.",
  "DIA_Gron_Bolt_15_03": "Einar said...",
  "DIA_Gron_Bolt_03_04": "Einar has memory problems. Give me a break.",
  "DIA_Gron_Serious_15_01": "The matter is very urgent.",
  "DIA_Gron_Serious_03_02": "Not for me. And if you're planning on bothering me, just remember, I know ways to get rid of pesky pests like you.",
  "DIA_Gron_Serious_03_03": "Goodbye.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_15_01": "I think we can get along.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_03_02": "Damn, I need to talk to Crednar about who he's letting in...",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Money_15_01": "Maybe a few coins will refresh your memory?",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Money_03_02": "What?! Who do you take me for? A simple mercenary? I'm a Wolf Son, I don't need your dirty money!",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Money_15_03": "Relax, I'm sure we'll get along...",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Money_03_04": "Get out of my face! I'm not going to talk to you anymore!",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Fight_15_01": "I guess I'll have to forcibly untie your tongue...",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Drink_15_01": "It's hard to talk with a dry mouth.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Drink_03_02": "Oh, now you're talking sense. Do you have anything decent to offer?",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Beer_15_01": "I have beer.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Beer_03_02": "Eh, seems like piss. You sure you don't have anything decent?",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Wine_15_01": "I have wine.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Wine_03_02": "What am I, a woman, to drink juices like that? Come on, you can do better than that.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_15_01": "I have something really strong.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_03_02": "We'll see. We'll try.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_15_03": "Here.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_03_04": "Oh, well, I can't say, it's very strong. Remind me, why are you here?",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_15_05": "I'd like to know what kind of bolts you use.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_03_06": "The kind for shooting, why?",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_15_07": "But ordinary, or maybe... exceptional?",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_03_08": "In the hands of an exceptional crossbowman, every bolt is exceptional.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_15_09": "Can't you answer more specifically?",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_03_10": "Eh, you brought me some good stuff... What, you said something about crossbows? I like to shoot crossbows...",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_15_11": "That's great! So... how about a little duel?",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_03_12": "What, you like it too?",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_15_13": "Yeah, I love it! Is there anywhere to shoot?",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_03_14": "Sure, there is one target in front of the walls that I often practice on. Come on!",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Bimber_03_15": "Aaah, it's over...",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Comeback_15_01": "I'll be right back with something decent.",
  "DIA_Gron_Talk_Comeback_03_02": "Oh, so I get some peace and quiet? Oh, great!",
  "DIA_Gron_GoAway_03_01": "I said something! Leave me alone!",
  "DIA_Gron_GoAway_03_02": "What, you want another hit? Get out of here!",
  "DIA_Gron_GoAway_03_03": "It doesn't change anything. With methods like that, no one's going to help you here.",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_03_01": "Okay, so... as the older of the two of us, I'll shoot first. Get ready for the reeeeal show!",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_03_02": "Oh, some strange sound that target made. Did I hit it at all?",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_15_03": "I'm not so sure... there was a farmer behind the target. Looks like he got hit pretty hard...",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_03_04": "What?! I'm out of here! If Ulryk finds out I'm shooting civilians...",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_03_05": "You won't turn me in? Tell me you won't turn me in!",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_15_06": "Let's think...",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_15_07": "What do you know about special boltheads for minecrawler hunting?",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_03_08": "Nothing really, I never liked using them. Mostly because I hate fighting those ants...",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_03_09": "Really, I can't tell you anything more, I swear!",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_15_10": "Okay, I believe you. You can go.",
  "DIA_Gron_Cutscene_03_11": "Thanks, man!",
  "DIA_Gron_HelpMine_15_01": "I need someone to guard the mine.",
  "DIA_Gron_HelpMine_03_02": "The mine is closed, no need to protect it.",
  "DIA_Gron_HelpMine_15_03": "I want to go down there. Someone needs to guard the entrance so the crawlers don't get into the Den. I think you're perfect for the job.",
  "DIA_Gron_HelpMine_03_04": "Oh no, thank you! I prefer other leisure activities than serving as dinner to some big ants!",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_15_01": "What if Ulryk finds out about you shooting civilians?",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_03_02": "He won't know about any of this because you screwed me! I asked around, nobody's been shot with a crossbow lately!",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_03_03": "You better be glad I didn't hit you right away!",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_ComeOn_15_01": "Come on, it was fun to shoot...",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_ComeOn_03_02": "And that's supposed to convince me? Don't make me laugh! Find yourself another idiot to guard the gate!",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_Alcohol_15_01": "Apparently mine guards get a discount on alcohol.",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_Alcohol_03_02": "If it was the case, I would have been standing outside the entrance long ago. You could have at least come up with a more elaborate lie.",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_Alcohol_03_03": "Now get off, you're disturbing my rest.",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_Jon_15_01": "I hear Jon's crew has been heard. They could come out of the mine at any moment, and it will be quite a spectacle...",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_Jon_03_02": "Really? Damn, that would be really good. If I saw that, I'd have a good story for my buddies...",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_Jon_03_03": "Okay, I'm going over there. See you there!",
  "DIA_Gron_Crossbow_15_00": "Could you show me how to handle a crossbow better?",
  "DIA_Gron_Crossbow_03_01": "You think you need my guidance? Fine, be that as it may, but I'm not going to teach an outsider for free.",
  "DIA_Gron_Crossbow_03_02": "You also need to know that I am very impatient. I have no strength for rookies, so if you want to learn the basics, find another teacher.",
  "DIA_Gron_Train_15_00": "Let's start training.",
  "DIA_Gron_Train_03_01": "Aha.",
  "DIA_Gron_Train_Back_03_00": "You already know something, but you still have a long way to go.",
  "DIA_Gron_Train_Back_03_01": "I won't teach you any more, no one will teach you any more. You're a master at your craft now.",
  "DIA_Gron_Train_CR1_13_01": "I won't teach you for that kind of money.",
  "DIA_Gron_Train_CR1_13_02": "I told you I don't teach rookies. Get more experience.",
  "DIA_Gron_Train_CR5_13_01": "A long lesson is a big payoff. Bring me more gold.",
  "DIA_Gron_Train_CR5_13_02": "Can you do anything at all? I don't think so.",
  "DIA_Gron_Ambient_15_01": "How are you doing?",
  "DIA_Gron_Ambient_03_02": "Don't you have something better to do? I'd like to get some rest after a tiring day.",
  "DIA_Gron_Ambient_03_03": "I have no intention of playing in any more shooting duels anytime soon. They are far too stressful!",
  "DIA_Gron_Shooting_Jon_Choice": "Jon's team was reportedly heard."
