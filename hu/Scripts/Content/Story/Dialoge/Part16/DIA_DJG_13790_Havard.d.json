  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_03_01": "I hear you're going into the mine. I have to say, for a city boy, you got a lot of guts.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Enough_15_01": "I've heard enough about being a city boy...",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Enough_03_02": "Sorry, it's just a habit. Most of the Archolos people we meet are mere wimps. Only gold and wine on their minds.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Point_15_01": "Are you up to something?",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Point_03_02": "Well, since you're going to mine, I have a request for you.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Point_03_03": "My friend Gaur was a guard at the mine. Unluckily, he was on duty when the crawlers attacked.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Point_03_04": "I know I shouldn't count on much, but I'd like you to try find him down there.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Point_03_05": "Even if he's already dead I'd like to know that he died like a warrior and be assured that he'll be seen off from this world as befits a Wolf Son.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Point_15_06": "Which is?",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Point_03_07": "According to our tradition, a warrior's body should be burned. I can't bear the thought of him lying there somewhere and being eaten by those disgusting crawlers...",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Why_15_01": "Why didn't you move inside yourself?",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Why_03_02": "Believe me, I tried.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Why_03_03": "Unfortunately, Ulryk decided that no one who had any connection to the people who stayed down there could go down into the mine.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Why_03_04": "He argues that this could create additional, unnecessary risk.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Why_03_05": "I respect his decision, but... Gaur is my friend and we have our traditions! His body can't just lie there!",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Why_03_06": "Who will we be if we abandon what makes us Wolf Sons?",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Okay_15_01": "Okay, I'll look for your friend.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Okay_03_02": "Thank you. Take care and show those damn beasts what real pain means.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_NeedHelp_Okay_03_03": "And one more thing, if Gaur were dead... you would recognize him by his signet ring with the purple stone. It had been in his family for many centuries.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_03_01": "Did you find him?",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_No_15_01": "I'm sorry, I didn't find your friend.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_No_03_02": "Damn, looks like I'll have to go down there myself and search the mine from top to bottom.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_No_03_03": "Screw Ulryk's orders. I will not leave my friend there.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_No_03_04": "Either way thank you for trying. Good luck in your journey.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_Yes_15_01": "I'm sorry, your friend is dead.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_Yes_03_02": "Damn it! I could feel it right from the start... but there was still a glimmer of hope.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_Yes_03_03": "How did he die?",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_Next_03_01": "Did you burn his body, according to our tradition?",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_Fall_15_01": "I think he fell from a height.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_Fall_03_02": "This is not how a warrior should die... But I'm sure he fought to the end.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_Fight_15_01": "He fell fighting an entire horde of crawlers.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_Fight_03_02": "Ahh, a death worthy of a warrior. That is how he will be remembered.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_Finish_03_01": "Thank you for your help stranger. Keep my companion's ring, you are an honorable warrior, you deserve it.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_BurnYes_15_01": "Yes, he will be able to have peace now.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_BurnYes_03_02": "You are not one of us, but there is more of the Wolf Son in you than in many of ours.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_BurnNo_15_01": "Unfortunately, there were too many of those beasts out there, I couldn't take any chances.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q404_AfterMine_BurnNo_03_02": "I understand. I don't blame you. The important thing is that I know what happened to him.",
  "DIA_Havard_What_15_01": "Havard? What is Wolf Son doing so far from home...",
  "DIA_Havard_What_03_02": "We meet again, good to see you warrior!",
  "DIA_Havard_What_03_03": "Yes, it's true, we rarely leave our hometowns. You might say that I'm here rather privately...",
  "DIA_Havard_What_03_04": "I help these farmers and villagers learn how to wield a sword from scratch.",
  "DIA_Havard_What_03_05": "Even if the stories about orcs aren't true, it still doesn't hurt if they can defend themselves against lurkers or field raiders.",
  "DIA_Havard_What_03_06": "Thanks again for this matter at the mine.",
  "DIA_Havard_What_03_07": "Now if you'll allow me, I'll go back to training. I promised them that they would learn to hit alternating right and left.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q509_Question_15_01": "Now I'm the one who needs your help.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q509_Question_15_02": "I'm going to the ruins of Vardhal and I'm looking for worthy warriors.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q509_Question_03_03": "Vardhal? But this is the resting place of Volfzack and our fallen brothers, what do you want to do there?",
  "DIA_Havard_Q509_Question_Artifact_15_01": "I am looking for a certain artifact that will help me convince the Water Mages to intervene in the affairs of the island.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q509_Question_Artifact_03_02": "An honorable and commendable act... Archolos needs, especially now, wise and prudent people to keep it from descending into utter chaos.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q509_Question_Artifact_03_03": "I will journey with you to the ruins of my ancestors' glory. You will gain your artifact, and I can help my brothers regain their eternal rest.",
  "DIA_Havard_Q509_Feel_03_02": "It's strange for me to see this place in such a state. Everything turned to ash and ruin in just a few moments...",
  "DIA_Havard_Q509_Question_Artifact_Choice": "I'm looking for a certain artifact..."
