  "DIA_GETORYX_QA401_FINAL_03_02": "After all, we all care about making a little money for ourselves...",
  "DIA_ADELARD_QA401_FINAL_03_04": "Now be so kind and don't prolong it any further.",
  "DIA_ADELARD_QA401_FINAL_03_05": "You! Jump!",
  "DIA_SMUGGLER_01_QA401_FINAL_03_06": "Please don't kill me! I didn't do anything!",
  "DIA_ADELARD_QA401_FINAL_03_07": "I guess you must have misheard... If you don't want to get hit by an arrow like your boss, then turn around and jump straight to your beach.",
  "DIA_ADELARD_QA401_FINAL_03_08": "You must love this place after all! This is where you smuggle goods, while completely destabilizing the city's trade.",
  "DIA_ADELARD_QA401_FINAL_03_09": "It will certainly be nice for you to feel that warm sand under your feet again.",

  "DIA_ADELARD_QA401_FINAL_03_13": "Well, this one probably won't smuggle anything anymore.",
  "DIA_ADELARD_QA401_FINAL_03_14": "And now it's time for you. You've been quiet from the start...",
  "DIA_ADELARD_QA401_FINAL_03_15": "I think I can find some work for you.",
  "DIA_ADELARD_QA401_FINAL_03_16": "I want you to start a new life. A life where at every opportunity you tell people that the Merchant's Guild is not worth messing with. Do we understand each other?",
  "DIA_SMUGGLER_02_QA401_FINAL_03_17": "Y-yes.",
  "DIA_ADELARD_QA401_FINAL_03_18": "Good, now get out of here and I don't want to see you again."
