  "DIA_Einar_SQ419_TanningCutscene_03_02": "Ah, yes, the Myrtanians' invasion. Not many writings have survived from that time. It was a long and nasty war.",
  "DIA_Einar_SQ419_TanningCutscene_03_03": "Despite the Myrtanians' devastating advantage, in the end they could not capture any of our strongholds.",
  "DIA_Einar_SQ419_TanningCutscene_03_04": "In an act of desperation and cowardice, they began to bring more fire mages to the island. And so, within a few weeks, the island was engulfed in flames, with ash constantly in the air.",
