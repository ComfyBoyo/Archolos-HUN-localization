  "DIA_Anskar_KQ406_Cutscene_03_01": "Why were you looking for me? Can't I even die in peace?",
  "DIA_Grayson_KQ406_Cutscene_03_02": "You idiot! We all thought you were dead! Do you know how long we searched for confirmation of this information?",
  "DIA_Grayson_KQ406_Cutscene_03_03": "A very long time, and as soon as I heard rumors that you had survived, I immediately organized a search.",
  "DIA_Anskar_KQ406_Cutscene_03_04": "Just to humiliate me before the King?",
  "DIA_Grayson_KQ406_Cutscene_03_05": "Humiliate? Man! I'm taking you home to your family, which is where you damn well belong!",
  "DIA_Grayson_KQ406_Cutscene_03_06": "You screwed up, and the whole kingdom will probably pay a heavy price for it, but I won't let your reputation be tarnished.",
  "DIA_Anskar_KQ406_Cutscene_03_07": "So Richard is dead... because of my vanity. I thought...",
  "DIA_Grayson_KQ406_Cutscene_03_08": "It's nice to hear what you think of me after knowing me for so many years. What an idiot!",
  "DIA_Grayson_KQ406_Cutscene_03_09": "It doesn't matter. You're safe now.",
  "DIA_Anskar_KQ406_Cutscene_03_10": "You don't understand. You weren't there, you didn't see what happened because of me...",
  "DIA_Grayson_KQ406_Cutscene_03_11": "Rest and get your strength back.",
  "DIA_Grayson_KQ406_Cutscene_03_12": "Your career is over, but if I have to beg on my knees for mercy for you before the King himself - I will.",
  "DIA_Anskar_KQ406_Cutscene_03_13": "Thank you. I need... I need to rest.",
  "DIA_Grayson_KQ406_Cutscene_03_14": "Exactly. In the meantime, I'm going back to work."
