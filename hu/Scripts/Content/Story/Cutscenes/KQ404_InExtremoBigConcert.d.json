  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_03_02": "Today we will make sure that you will not forget this evening for a long time!",
  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_03_03": "Our music will make you dance. Let the fire ignite in your hearts!",
  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_03_04": "But before that happens, we want to show you something!",
  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_03_05": "That's Herman! A hard-working man who was forced by the war to do things he would never have done under other circumstances!",
  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_03_06": "To survive, he stole food from those who don't want to share their prosperity with the ones in need!",
  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_03_07": "And here are the mighty and wise Fire Mages! Those who by their virtue and knowledge should put us to shame!",
  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_03_08": "Not this time, dear friends. Mages at the behest of the King often serve as judges!",

  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_03_10": "Tell me! Did Herman deserve this fate? Is the punishment appropriate to his deed?",
  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_03_11": "Don't answer that! Each of you must answer that question for yourself.",
  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_03_12": "And now! Let's play! One, two, three...",
  "DIA_KQ404_InExtremoBigConcert_15_13": "Euric! Now!"
